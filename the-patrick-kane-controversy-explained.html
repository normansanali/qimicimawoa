Please read with caution.</strong></p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=168 data-current-count=168 data-injectable=false>In 2015, Chicago Black Hawks right winger <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Kane</a></strong> was <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of sexual assault</a>. Here are details from the case and why charges against the NHL star were dropped.</p><p data-characters=331 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=true>According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Bleacher Report</a>, Kane, who was then 26, was in Buffalo, New York, when he allegedly raped a woman he just met at his home near Buffalo late one night. The Kane accusations were controversial, as DNA evidence failed to support what she said happened. She did, however, have visible bite marks and scratches on her body.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>The woman’s lawyer said the rape kit may have been tampered with, but he later backtracked on those statements and even <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">fired the plaintiff as a client, claiming he was misled</a>. Kane denied the allegations, and in Sept. 2015, hockey journalist Frank Seravalli tweeted Kane’s comment on the case:</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=606 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>Kane: "Once all the facts come to light, I am confident I will be absolved of having done nothing wrong."</p>— Frank Seravalli (@frank_seravalli) <a href=#>September 17, 2015</a> via Frank Seravalli/X</figure><p data-characters=101 data-current-count=101 data-injectable=false>Amid the investigation, Kane’s career took a hit, but controversially, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">he was never suspended</a>.</p><h2 data-injectable=false>The Kane accuser received massive public scrutiny</h2><p data-characters=450 data-current-count=551 data-injectable=true>While the investigation was ongoing, the accuser in the Patrick Kane case was threatened on social media, especially among Chicago Blackhawks fans, who claimed to have revealed her identity and even said they knew where she lived. Kane, meanwhile, refused to speak to the police, but according to Erie County prosecutor Frank Sedita III, he made no known incriminating statements or behaved in any way that would suggest guilt, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian </a>reported.</p><p data-characters=190 data-current-count=190 data-injectable=false>According to The Guardian, evidence also suggests that the mother of the accuser may have been involved in the accusations, and that she may have orchestrated a hoax related to the rape kit.</p><h2 id=h-patrick-kane-s-2015-charges-were-dropped-for-lack-of-evidence data-injectable=false>Patrick Kane’s 2015 charges were dropped for lack of evidence</h2><p data-characters=390 data-current-count=580 data-injectable=true>By Nov. 15 that year, the charges against Patrick Kane were dropped for lack of evidence. By that point, the accuser, who was also in her 20s, said she would no longer cooperate with the investigation over the “tremendous stress” the investigation caused for her and her family. She also reportedly signed a “non-prosecution affidavit” before the case was dismissed.</p><p data-characters=310 data-current-count=310 data-injectable=false>When the decision to drop charges was announced, prosecutor Frank Sedita III said, “The totality of the credible evidence — the proof — does not sufficiently substantiate the complainant’s allegation that she was raped by Patrick Kane and this so-called ‘case’ is rife with reasonable doubt.”</p><p data-characters=247 data-current-count=557 data-injectable=true>Born in Buffalo, Kane played for the Chicago Blackhawks for 16 years before he was traded to the New York Rangers. In the 2024 season, Kane played for the Detroit Red Wings and faced <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">his old team, the Blackhawks, for the first time</a> since he left.</p><p data-characters=131 data-current-count=131 data-injectable=false>If you know someone suffering from sexual violence, contact <a href=#>RAINN</a> or the National Sexual Abuse Telephone Hotline at 1-800-656-4673.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpbyzwNJoq6GdXaWutb7InKJmo5Gjsm6vzqerq6emmr%2B0xYyer6mkkZ67prCO</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-is-emma-watson-really-like-to-date-relationship-history.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What Emma Watson Is Really Like In A Relationship: The Truth About Her Mysterious Dating Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./smokepurpp-rapper-net-worth-236357.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>SmokePurpp Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
