She landed her first film role in the 1952 musical film&nbsp;</span><span>Delighted to Watch,</span><span>&nbsp;alongside Kathryn Grayson and Red Skelton.&nbsp;That same year, she was also cast as the lead actress in</span><i><span>&nbsp;Moulin Rouge.</span></i></p><p><span>She was an absolutely fine actress, but that wasn’t the only thing the Hungarian beauty was known for.&nbsp;Zsa Zsa Gabor was an epitome of Hollywood life, all about beauty, glamor and unabashed extravagance.&nbsp;She is considered the first known professional celebrity, more like a precursor to Kim Kardashian.&nbsp;Even though there was no social media to help propagate his personality at that time, Gabor managed to stir up enough controversy to stay in the public eye.</span></p><p><span>Her reputation as a Hollywood socialite grew much larger than her acting talent and in the 1960s she started appearing in films as herself.&nbsp;Apart from being a Hollywood socialite, Gabor was also famous for having had many husbands.&nbsp;She lived a very long life that spanned almost 10 decades, long enough that she married 9 different men.</span></p><p><strong><span>See also: Kim Kardashian’s sisters and husband</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Her sisters</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor was born alongside two sisters, one younger and the other older.&nbsp;The three sisters eventually moved to the United States where they lived the rest of their lives.&nbsp;If you think the Kardashian sisters are notorious, then you probably haven’t heard of the Gabor sisters, the Gabor sisters were the Kardashians before the Kardashians.</span></p><p><span>The oldest of the Magda Gabor sisters was an American actress and socialite.&nbsp;During World War II, Magda fled her home country of Hungary due to its occupation by Nazi forces.&nbsp;She fled to Portugal with the then Portuguese Ambassador to Hungary Carlos Sampaio Garrido.&nbsp;After some time, she moved to Brazil, from where she finally arrived in the United States in 1946.</span></p><p><span>Upon her arrival in the United States, Magda Gabor quickly married an American citizen and remained in the United States until her death in 1997. Like her famous sister Zsa Zsa, Magda had her fair share of marital unions , 6 in all.&nbsp;One of her husbands was British actor George Sanders, who was previously married to Magda’s sister, Zsa Zsa.&nbsp;She had no children during her lifetime.</span></p><p><span>The youngest of the Gabor sisters, Eva Gabor was an actress, singer, businesswoman, and socialite.&nbsp;She moved to the United States shortly after marrying a Swedish doctor.&nbsp;Her acting prowess has crossed over to movies, television, and she’s also been successful on Broadway.&nbsp;She had 5 marriages during her life but she had no children.</span></p><p><strong><span>Spouse(s) of Zsa Zsa Gabor</span></strong></p><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor is remembered as a Hollywood actress and socialite, but we can also never forget her many marriages.&nbsp;She has been married 9 times in total.&nbsp;According to her, men loved her and she loved them too, so why not?</span></p><p><span>The most famous of her husbands are the founder of the Hilton dynasty, Conrad Hilton and British actor, George Sanders.&nbsp;7 of these marriages ended in divorce (as expected) and one of the marriages was declared null and void.&nbsp;Her last marriage was the longest and only ended due to her death.</span></p><p><strong><span>Here is a sequential order of Zsa Zsa Gabor’s husbands:</span></strong></p><p><span>1. Belgian Burhan Asaf: They married in 1935 and divorced in 1941, shortly before Gabor moved to the United States.</span></p><p><span>2. Conrad Hilton: They married in 1942 and divorced in 1947. According to Gabor, the late hotel magnate denied him freedom when they married.&nbsp;Their union produced a child.</span></p><p><span>3. George Sanders: They married in 1949 and divorced after 5 years in 1954. The British actor later married Gabor’s older sister, Magda Gabor.</span></p><p><span>4. Herbert Hutner: They got married in 1962. According to Gabor, Hutner didn’t give her the freedom to pursue acting and so the marriage ended in 1966.</span></p><p><span>5. Joshua S. Cosden, Jr: This was the first shortest of his marriages, it only lasted one year, from 1966 to 1967.</span></p><p><span>6. Jack Ryan: Like the previous one, this marriage only lasted one year, from 1975 to 1976.</span></p><p><span>7. Michael O’Hara: It lasted 7 years between 1976 and 1983.</span></p><p><span>8. Felipe de Alba: The marriage between Gabor and Felipe de Alba was contracted on April 13, 1983, but for some reason it was declared null and void only 24 hours after.</span></p><p><span>9. Frederic Prinz von Anhalt: She married Frederic Prinz von Anhalt in 1986.</span></p><p><span>After her 8th marriage was annulled just after one day, Zsa Zsa Gabor gave love one more shot.&nbsp;On August 14, 1986, she married Frederic Prinz von Anhalt, a German-American entrepreneur and adoptive descendant of Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt.</span></p><p><span>The marriage lasted 30 years and ended in 2016 due to the death of Gabor.&nbsp;The couple had no children, however, they adopted 10 adult men.&nbsp;The adult males had each paid $2 million to be adopted to become descendants of Princess Marie-Auguste of Anhalt.&nbsp;Frederick Prinz von Anhalt had paid the princess a few years earlier to be adopted by her so that he would be eligible for the title of “Prince”.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Meet Gabor’s Daughter</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor had only one child in her life, Constance Francesca Gabor Hilton.&nbsp;Gabor had the child during her marriage to the late American hotelier Conrad Hilton.&nbsp;According to Gabor, the pregnancy took place after she was raped by her then-husband.</span></p><p><span>Constance Francesca Hilton was born on March 10, 1947.&nbsp;She died aged 67 on January 5, 2015, a year before her mother died.&nbsp;She was a great-aunt of the famous American media personality and socialites, Paris Hilton.</span></p><p><strong><span>See also: Hugh Hefner Dead, fortune, partners, wife, girlfriends, children</span></strong></p><h2><strong><span>Is Zsa Zsa Gabor dead or alive?</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor lived a very long life, only 2 months before her centenary.&nbsp;The Hungarian-born socialite died on December 18, 2016, at the age of 99.&nbsp;She died of a heart attack in the Los Angeles home she shared with her husband Frederic Prinz von Anhalt.</span></p><h2><strong><span>His net worth</span></strong></h2><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor’s latest estimate was worth around $40 million, however, it is unknown how much of this fortune remained at the time of his death.&nbsp;Much of her wealth was acquired during her acting career, not to mention her prestigious marriages to millionaires.</span></p><p><span>In his later years, Gabor battled illnesses that ate up much of his wealth.&nbsp;Her husband Frederic Prinz von Anhalt had to sell their house to pay his medical bills.&nbsp;Poor health isn’t the only thing that’s taken Gabor’s money, however.</span></p><p><span>Throughout her nearly 100-year life, ZsaZsa Gabor was all about the good life.&nbsp;She loved partying with the big and powerful, and as we all know, partying with the rich costs a lot of money.&nbsp;At the peak of her career, Gabor was known to have over 5,000 designer pieces in her closet.</span></p><p><span>Apart from her lavish lifestyle, the late socialite has also been the victim of 2 major frauds.&nbsp;In 2005, Gabor filed a lawsuit against his only daughter Constance Francesca Gabor Hilton for forging her signature to secure a $2 million loan.&nbsp;She was also duped out of $7 million by infamous con artist Bernie Madoff.</span></p><p><span>Zsa Zsa Gabor was certainly not the most cautious of her generation, nor did she leave much wealth behind.&nbsp;However, she always had enough for herself, as she never filed for bankruptcy and was debt-free.</span></p><p class=postsid
