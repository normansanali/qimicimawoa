So I was able to personally meet with Mr Skarupa and gab about beer and home brewing.</p><p>It turns out that there a number of employees who home brew. They have even considered starting their own club but with the crazy schedule they work it hasn’t come to fruition yet. At the end of my time there I left with some of Kevin’s beer (The Pop Corn Pilsner was very good) and a firm belief that home brewers will rule the world one day.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=interview></span>Interview<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p><strong>Q: How did you get started home brewing?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> My wife bought me a brew kit 5 years ago for my birthday, it was love at first brew from there!</p><p><strong>Q: How often do you get to brew?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> I brew when I can, I must have made 4 or 5 brews last year</p><p><strong>Q: Do you have a favorite style of beer?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> I am lucky that my palette likes and can appreciate most beer styles. What’s great is I probably have only scratched the surface on all the different kinds and styles across the world…a hobby you can have for life!</p><p><strong>Q: Do you belong to any NH Home brew Clubs?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> I don’t belong to any…yet. I have a feeling over the next few years as my interest grows further,<br>that will be the logical next step. I listen to a lot of beer podcasts and the options are endless.</p><p><strong>Q: What is it that you like most about home brewing?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> I really, really enjoy the brew day itself. I started out like most, doing kits to learn the process. Now<br>I like to tinker with established recipes and make them my own. It is truly a lot of fun!</p><p><strong>Q: What was the last beer you brewed?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> A Popcorn Pilsner was the last one I brewed (this a clone from Sun King Brewing mentioned on the<br>Brewing Network episode date 02-13-2012)</p><p><strong>Q: What are your favorite New Hampshire beers?</strong></p><p><strong>Skarupa:</strong> My top 3 in no particular order…Throwback’s Spicy Bohemian, Milly’s Pumpkin, and Woodstock<br>Inn’s Maple Porter.</p><p><strong>SOURCE: nhbeerscene.blogspot.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKOVq7avedKkmKutoJZ6o7XOoKmaqJiueqKzxGalnqxdrLyzwMdmrqKelWKvprHRZqCnrJWnw6qx1mg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./leah-reminis-daughter-is-her-twin.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Leah Remini's Daughter Is Her Twin</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./helen-hunts-net-worth.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Helen Hunts Net Worth : Career &amp;amp; Lifestyle</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
