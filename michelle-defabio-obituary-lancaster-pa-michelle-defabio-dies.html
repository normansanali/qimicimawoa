His journey had been one of 78 years, and within that time, he had touched countless lives with his warmth, love, and the indomitable spirit that defined him. Michele’s life may have come to an end, but the memories and love he shared remain eternal.&nbsp;Michele’s legacy was defined by his roles as a loving father, cherished grandfather, and dear sibling. He leaves behind a rich tapestry of memories and a profound sense of love and devotion.</p><p>His son, Anthony DiFabio, and Anthony’s wife Megan of Cranston, along with cherished grandchildren Michael, Lily, and Sophie DiFabio, were at the heart of Michele’s world. In them, he found his purpose and joy, a testament to the depth of his love.&nbsp;At Michele’s side throughout his life was his beloved spouse, Margherita DiFabio (Cairone). Theirs was a love that weathered the storms of time, growing stronger with each passing year. Their partnership was a beacon of love and commitment, serving as an inspiration to those who had the privilege of witnessing it.</p><p>Michele’s family extended beyond his immediate circle. He was the sibling of Enrico, Sandro, and Grazie, and the son of Antonio and Maria DiFabio. His deep connections to his siblings and parents were a testament to the importance of family in his life. Michele’s familial bonds were a source of strength and support, and they enriched his life in countless ways.</p><p>As a community gathered to say their final goodbyes, Michele’s funeral was a poignant moment of reflection and celebration. On that Friday morning at 9 a.m., family and friends joined together at the Nardolillo Funeral Home & Crematory, located at 1278 Park Ave., Cranston. From there, they proceeded to St. Bartholomew’s Church, situated at 297 Laurel Hill Ave., Providence, where a Mass of Christian Burial took place at 10 a.m.</p><p>It was a solemn yet uplifting service, one that honored the memory of Michele and the love he had shared. Michele’s earthly journey found its closure in the hallowed grounds of St. Ann Cemetery, Cranston. As the beloved son, husband, father, grandfather, and sibling was laid to rest, those who had known him cherished the moments they had shared and bid him a peaceful and eternal farewell.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmidpJq%2Fr63Loaanp6Keu6h6wqikaKWZmLWmuMueZJ2dlpavqruMqJmirKWWv7p5y5qlnJmjqbKzec%2BaZKahk52yrbjEZpuenpGXtrB5w6KcrGc%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./pedro-pascals-iconic-met-gala-moment-from-2019-goes-viral-ahead-of-the-2023-event.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Pedro Pascals iconic Met Gala moment from 2019 goes viral ahead of the 2023 event</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./minnie-ida-anderson-maya-rudolph-daughter-paul-thomas-anderson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Meet Minnie Ida Anderson Photos Of Maya Rudolphs Daughter With Partner Paul Thomas Anderson</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
