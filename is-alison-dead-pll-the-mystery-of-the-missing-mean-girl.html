Alison was the queen bee of Rosewood High School, who knew everyone’s secrets and used them to manipulate and blackmail people. She was also the target of many enemies, who wanted to see her suffer or dead. But is Alison dead PLL? What really happened to her on the night she vanished? And who is behind the “A” messages that torment her friends? Here is a summary of the main events and revelations that answer these questions.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison was buried alive by her mother, but rescued by a psychic</h2><p>In the pilot episode of Pretty Little Liars, it is revealed that Alison went missing a year ago, after a sleepover with her friends. The police found a body in her backyard, which was identified as hers. However, in season 4, episode 24, “A is for Answers”, it is revealed that Alison is actually alive, and that she faked her death to escape from “A”. She tells her friends that on the night she disappeared, she was hit on the head with a rock by an unknown assailant, and buried alive by her own mother, Jessica DiLaurentis, who thought she was dead and wanted to protect the killer. Alison was saved by Mrs. Grunwald, a psychic who sensed her distress and pulled her out of the grave. Alison then ran away from Rosewood, with the help of Mona Vanderwaal, who later became the first “A”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The body in Alison’s grave was Bethany Young, a Radley patient</h2><p>Although Alison was alive, there was still a body in her grave, which was later revealed to be Bethany Young, a patient at Radley Sanitarium, a mental institution. Bethany had a connection to Alison’s family, as she was having an affair with Alison’s father, Peter Hastings, and was also the daughter of Jessica’s twin sister, Mary Drake, who was also a Radley patient. Bethany hated Alison and Jessica, and escaped from Radley on the night Alison disappeared, wearing Alison’s clothes. She was mistaken for Alison by Melissa Hastings, Spencer’s sister, who buried her alive, thinking she was protecting Spencer, who had a fight with Alison earlier. Bethany’s death was also linked to CeCe Drake, another Radley patient, who was Alison’s transgender sister, and the second “A”. CeCe had befriended Bethany at Radley, and planned to kill Alison as revenge for ruining her life. However, she accidentally hit Bethany with a rock, thinking she was Alison, and fled the scene.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison returned to Rosewood, but faced more danger and drama</h2><p>After revealing herself to her friends, Alison decided to return to Rosewood, hoping to start a new life. However, she soon realized that she was not welcome by everyone, as she had made many enemies with her lies and schemes. She also faced more danger and drama, as she became the target of a new “A”, who was later revealed to be Charlotte DiLaurentis, aka CeCe Drake, her transgender sister, who wanted to punish her and her friends for not appreciating her. Alison also had to deal with her complicated love life, as she had romantic relationships with several people, such as Ian Thomas, Ezra Fitz, Lorenzo Calderon, and Emily Fields. She also married Archer Dunhill, who pretended to be Elliott Rollins, a doctor who treated Charlotte at Welby State Psychiatric Hospital. Archer was actually working with Mary Drake, Jessica’s twin sister, who wanted to avenge Charlotte’s death and take over the DiLaurentis family fortune. Archer tortured Alison at Welby, until he was killed by Hanna Marin, one of Alison’s friends.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Alison is alive and well, but still involved in mysteries and secrets</h2><p>At the end of Pretty Little Liars, Alison is alive and well, but still involved in mysteries and secrets. She is divorced from Emily Fields, with whom she had twin daughters, Grace and Lily, who were conceived with Emily’s eggs that were stolen by Archer. She is also a co-owner of the Carissimi Group, a mysterious organization that was founded by Charlotte, and a co-owner of the Lost Woods Resort, a motel where she and her friends used to hide from “A”. She is also a teaching assistant at Beacon Heights University, where she moved to start a new career and a new life. However, she soon found herself in the middle of another murder mystery, involving a group of students known as the Perfectionists, who were accused of killing their professor, who was also the mastermind behind a new “A” game. Alison helped the Perfectionists clear their names, and also discovered more secrets about her family, such as the existence of another secret sibling, Alex Drake, who was Spencer’s twin sister, and the third “A”.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Is Alison dead PLL? No, she is not</h2><p>In conclusion, Alison is not dead PLL, but she has been through a lot of twists and turns in her life. She was buried alive by her mother, but rescued by a psychic. She faked her death to escape from “A”, but returned to Rosewood to face more danger and drama. She was involved in many mysteries and secrets, but also found love and friendship. She is a survivor, a liar, a leader, and a legend. She is Alison DiLaurentis.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmikmZh6rrHRnJ%2BapqRjsLC5jpuss7JfnsBurcuiqqimXZmyorCMqaOlZaSdsm652KyrnqqpYrynedOhnGalmajAqrrGZqSemZ5itKq%2By2g%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./wrestlers-unmasked-jushin-thunder-liger.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Jushin Thunder Liger &amp;amp; 9 Other Shocking Wrestlers Unmasked</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-lawrence-movies-salary-equal-pay.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Here's Why Jennifer Lawrence Learnt To Negotiate Her Movie Salary The Hard Way</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
