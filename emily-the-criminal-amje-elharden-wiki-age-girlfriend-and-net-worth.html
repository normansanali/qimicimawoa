The movie "Twice Bitten," which is his most recent offering, is currently streaming on BET live TV.</p><p>His other works include The Archenemy and The Hunt. He is also getting limelight from the movie Emily the Criminal, and people are curious to know more about the actor.</p><h2 id=quick-facts>Quick Facts</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Amje Elharden</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>around 30</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Profession</strong></td><td>Actor, Stuntman</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=amje-elharden-wikipedia-a>Amje Elharden Wikipedia And Age</h2><p>Actor Amje Elharden appears to be between 30 and 35 years old based on his profile. His age would not be apparent if it weren't for the fact that he has gray hair. Despite his advancing years, he maintains a top-notch <a href=# rel=noopener>physique</a>. He has a fierce passion for physical training.</p><p>Elharden began appearing in motion pictures in 2017. He didn't start taking movie acting seriously until this year, though. He made his acting debut in a Transparent: The Lost Sessions episode. Read more on IMDb about his films.</p><p>[image-1]</p><p>Ajme's subsequent role was in the television film My Daughter's Ransom. The Starling is the next one that has yet to be revealed. He is a rising Hollywood star with a lot of potentials and has gradually received all the attention he deserves.</p><p>Twice Bitten, the actor's most recent film, brought him notoriety. In the movie Twice Bitten, an unquestionably gorgeous con guy targets the widowed Monique for his most recent ruse. However, as suspicion rises, his typical swindle encounters a problem, and his plan quickly descends into desperation, betrayal, and murder.</p><p>The film is directed by Patricia Cuffie-Jones and stars Miah Blake, Justin Berti, and Lisa Raye McCoy, among others. Although it was launched on July 11, it is now available for streaming.</p><h2 id=who-is-amje-elhardens-gir>Who Is Amje Elharden's Girlfriend?</h2><p>Amje Elharden hasn't yet revealed many details about his close pal. We know a little about him because he doesn't have a Wikipedia handle.</p><p>We must assume he is single until he outs himself officially because he hasn't mentioned his girlfriend anywhere, not even on Instagram. He is tall and physically attractive enough to captivate any woman.</p><p>[image-2]</p><p>Looking at Amje Elharden's Instagram does not imply that he is married or has children. On Amje's Instagram posts, her mother Ayelin usually leaves comments. Furthermore, there are no signs regarding a prospective wife.</p><p>Instead of starting a family, Elharden focuses all his energy on acting and exercising. Elharden does not appear to be a member of any other ethnic group in America, and we can infer from his name that he is of Islamic descent. His true characteristics and history, however, remain a mystery.</p><p>His friends made a few remarks in Arabic. Therefore, it is safe to presume that the large man is Muslim. Visit his Instagram feed at @amjeelharden for additional details.</p><h2 id=how-rich-is-amje-elharden>How Rich Is Amje Elharden?</h2><p>Amje Elharden hasn't yet made many financial disclosures. He works as an actor and a stuntman; as we all know, actors get paid generously.</p><p>He resides in a lavish home and is now working hard and receiving preferential treatment from producers and directors. Although he hasn't disclosed his <a href=# rel=noopener>net worth</a>, we can infer that his career has brought him a substantial fortune.</p><p>[image-3]</p><p>Amje prefers to lead a moral life and gives to the needy and underprivileged. He is a kind and humble individual, and people adore him for these qualities.</p><p>Amje has recently worked in the film industry and is gradually gaining notoriety.
