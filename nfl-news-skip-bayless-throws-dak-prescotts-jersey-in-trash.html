The veteran sports analyst was livid after the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Dallas Cowboys</a> took a hefty beating at the hands of their rivals, the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">San Francisco 49ers</a>.</p><p>Bayless, who is a self-proclaimed Cowboys fanatic, has seen it all. From watching the team’s dark ages of the mid-80s to <strong>Troy Aikman</strong> and <strong>Michael Irvin</strong> winning back-to-back Super Bowls, the 71-year-old has been there. So he knows what it feels like to support the Star Helmets.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><p></p></figure><p>In all honesty, Bayless was every Cowboys fan’s spirit animal when they lost 42-10 to the California franchise. That’s the one team every Dallas faithful wants to see their team get a W at any cost. However, that illustrious victory has been hard to come by for them recently. <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jerry Jones</a></strong>‘ team lost to the 49ers in the playoffs for two consecutive years.</p><p>But Sunday’s loss was hard to take for Skip Bayless. He was looking forward to watching a dominant display, which never happened. After the game, the FOX Sports 1 Undisputed host threw a Dak Prescott jersey into the trash can in frustration.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>The interesting fact is what he did next. Bayless held out a <strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Micah Parsons</a> </strong>Cowboys shirt and was about to do the same as he did with Prescott’s. To everyone’s surprise, he chose against it.</p><p><strong>Related:</strong> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">WATCH: Referees urging Chiefs CB L’Jarius Sneed to put his helmet on instead of penalizing him brews massive theories of NFL being rigged in KC’s favor</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-did-skip-bayless-only-throw-dak-prescott-s-jersey>Why did Skip Bayless only throw Dak Prescott’s jersey?</h2><p>ESPN’s <strong>Mike Greenberg</strong> once said that Dak Prescott receives a lot of criticism. It may be a bit too much at times. However, looking at the 30-year-old’s record in the last couple of years, it’s fair to say that analysts are not entirely wrong.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/firstsportz.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Q_1696832186-1200x675.jpg><p><strong><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Stephen A. Smith</a></strong>, in most of the Dallas Cowboys segments on ‘Get Up’, singles out Prescott as being the sole reason for the team’s losses in crunch time. This was the case yesterday as well.</p><p>Dallas started woefully yesterday at Levi’s Stadium, failing to register any points in the first quarter. Prescott redeemed himself with an accurate deep ball to second-year receiver <strong>KaVonte Turpin</strong>. That was probably the only bright spot of the game for the Cowboys.</p><p>The 49ers were dominant, with <strong>George Kittle </strong>scoring his first-ever hat-trick.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> <strong>Christian McCaffrey</strong></a><strong> </strong>and <strong>Jordan Mason</strong> had one endzone run a piece. Quarterback <strong>Brock Purdy</strong> was on top of his game once again, completing 17/24 passes for 252 yards and 4 touchdowns.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>However, the same can’t be said about Dak Prescott. For the first time this season, he didn’t cross the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">200-yard threshold</a>. He only managed passing yards, 14 of 24 completions, only 1 touchdown, and 3 interceptions. The irony is that coming into Sunday’s game; he had only thrown one interception all season.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"></figure><p>A defeat at the hands of the 49ers means the Dallas Cowboys are now 3-2. Next, they will be on the road once again, traveling to LA to face the Los Angeles Chargers on October 16.</p><p><strong>In case you missed it:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57zZ%2BjZqaVrMBuv8qip2aaka65pr%2FSZquhqp%2BswG6wwKRkqaqVqLCwwNOsZKOdoqiyunnIp2StqpGotXA%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./who-is-loreal-palmer-claim-to-fame-brings-keke-palmers-elder-sister-into-highlight-tassco.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who is Loreal Palmer?
