I am not asking this question to you but this is a TikTok trend that started on Vine way earlier. The video is really goofy and funny but so random and almost insensible in a way. There is a way to put muffins in the freezer and you have to do it properly.</p><p>Some people have made different variations on the trend and used other things that resemble muffins instead of muffins. Some people find this trend funny but some people really don’t get why people find this funny at all. After all, humor is subjective and not everyone can find the same thing funny.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-is-%e2%80%9cwho-put-the-muffins-in-the-freezer%e2%80%9d-trend></span> <strong>What Is “Who Put The Muffins In The Freezer?” Trend&nbsp;</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There are many TikToks that feature great hacks and are supposedly those that make your daily lives easier. Amongst these videos, people make lots of food-related hacks and this video is one of these types.</p><p>The idea of the TikTok video is that people say, “Who put the muffins in the freezer?” and open their refrigerator. when they open their refrigerator, sometimes they have something else that resembles muffins rather than muffins on the fridge.</p><p>As you saw in this video, the guy opens up a fridge and says who put the muffins in the fridge, and instead of actual muffins, there is a ginger cat that looks like a muffin. I’d have to say that this video is more cute than funny but this is the trend that we are talking about. Goofy, kinda funny and cute.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=muffin-trend-on-vine></span> <strong>Muffin Trend On Vine</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Before this trend blew up in TikTok, this trend made its round on Vine a while ago before the ultimate demise of Vine. Vine went away but the vines never died. that’s a very poetic way to say things but after Vine ended, Viners migrated to YouTube and other platforms.</p><p>Soon enough, TikTok came to the horizon and people who were making vines found a similar space because of the short format of the TikTok. There are many TikToks that emulate this Vine energy and that’s why it’s appropriate to say that “Vine” as an app is dead but vines are alive.</p><p>On Vine, people used to do the same thing. They opened up their fridge and said who put the muffins in the fridge and took out a ct or something. The punchline is in the fact that what’s taken out of the fridge and the more absurd it is, the funnier it is.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-to-make-your-own-%e2%80%9cwho-put-muffin-on-fridge%e2%80%9d-video></span> <strong>How To Make Your Own “Who Put Muffin On Fridge?” Video</strong><br><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you want to actually put muffins in the freezer, there is a bunch of complicated steps to follow. I mean, it’s not that complicated but you will have to do it properly. But making the video is a bit easier than doing the actual thing. Here are some pointers to make this type of video:</p><li>Put something other than muffins in the fridge but something that closely resembles muffins.</li><li>Remember that, the more absurd the thing that you pull out, the funnier it is. Be creative and try to be as outrageous as you can.</li><li>Put an appropriate song on the background if you want to, because a nice song really elevates a video to the next level.</li><p>So, there you have it! This is the way to make muffin videos on TikTok. Make sure you put trending hashtags on the video so that more people see your videos. But the idea is just to have fun and keep on making the videos.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqxwdNmq6GdXaLCp7LIp6pmoZ5iwamxjJ%2Bpnp2qmr9uwMikq6ijXau2r7GMrameppRisrm8y5qgp52UZA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./zotac-showcases-mini-geforce-gtx-1080-ti-video-cards.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Zotac Showcases Mini GeForce GTX 1080 Ti Video Cards</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./band-members-of-the-runaways.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Are the Band Members of the Runaways?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
