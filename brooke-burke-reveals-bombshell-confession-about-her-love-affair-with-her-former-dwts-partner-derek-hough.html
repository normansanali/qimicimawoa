As she got to know him better, she was taken aback by his undeniable talent, saying, "I had no idea he would be such a powerful, badass choreographer."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/06fa90d1c363-gettyimages-93734908-1.jpg><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=efkn9y-OUmI data-wc=38>Brooke, a mother of four, went on to confess something that left listeners astounded. If she hadn't been bound by marital ties, she would've "actually hoped" for a "love affair" with Derek, a decorated three-time Emmy Award winner.&nbsp;</p><p id=eQE7MUp087w data-wc=29>She detailed the unique intimacy that dance fosters, explaining: "You are intertwined with someone's body when you're not a dancer... So for three months, you are in someone's arms."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/71401eff348f-gettyimages-93734871.jpg><p id=ePkIeMph9To data-wc=44>Elaborating on the deep connection she felt with Derek, Brooke said: "You smell them, you feel them, you're breathing with them. It can be more intimate than making love in a bedroom — you're making love on a dance floor, you feel more connected."&nbsp;</p><p id=epDLNuIaDKn data-wc=19>She highlighted the trust and vulnerability involved, emphasizing that the experience was akin to relying entirely on one another.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bb7a048610c2-gettyimages-93734840.jpg><p id=eDcRi--okpE data-wc=20>Despite their eventual triumph in the seventh season of the hit ABC show, the duo faced their share of hurdles.&nbsp;</p><p id=ebJkZQ2NIbP data-wc=30>They struggled to find harmony on the dance floor, prompting them to attend couples therapy. Brooke detailed their challenges, noting, "We weren't connected. We weren't gelling. We were having issues."&nbsp;</p><p id=ef57LauVe3L data-wc=24>She cited Derek's exhaustion from recording an album and her own physical and emotional fatigue after recently giving birth to her daughter, Shaya Braven.</p><p id=eiDFVh1rfRJ data-wc=22>Emphasizing their contrasting life stages, Brooke said: "I was a woman and a mother. I felt like he was a young man."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/19f467d7a88e-gettyimages-93722781.jpg><p id=e5TU1F-Qof2 data-wc=28>To bridge the gap, they sought guidance from a life coach, a session Brooke felt was raw and genuine, expressing surprise that it never made it on air.</p><p id=emtSXYedIqw data-wc=22>Reflecting on Derek's early career during their season, Brooke mentioned that he seemed more passive about winning due to his limited experience.&nbsp;</p><p id=e_VG-BW6-uJ data-wc=32>In her words: "I knew his young mind. I knew he wasn't competing to win." She believed that both entered the competition for exposure rather than the Mirrorball Trophy, which seemed unattainable.</p><p id=e6XLZfRmNTsE data-wc=29>Their victory, however, transformed Brooke's perspective. She remarked: "It changed my whole life." Continuing her association with the show, Brooke later co-hosted DWTS from its tenth to seventeenth season.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ21rZG58o77OqKKeZZKqv6yxjKucr52RocBurs6mmayglaG5bq%2FOp52eq6OevK95wJumrqxdnbKzecuorZ5lkZuzorXRZq6irJhitaa%2BjJ%2Bmq6WVp3qlw9OsZKmZoqm7pr6MnZyrnZtitbDBxqFm</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./can-you-change-balls-on-the-green.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Can you change balls on the green?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./bethany-lily-april.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Bethany Lily April- Wiki, Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Dating, Height</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
