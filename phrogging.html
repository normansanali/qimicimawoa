Items mysteriously rearranged themselves around the house. Full bottles of alcohol suddenly became empty.</p><p>Then, on December 8, 1986, Bowen and her father returned home to find a bone-chilling sight: a stranger in one of their closets with a painted face, a Native American-style jacket, a ninja mask, and a hatchet in hand.</p><p>He forced the Bowens into a bedroom before running off into another part of the home. Tina used the opportunity to escape and call the police.</p><p>Authorities arrived and found that the stranger was a teenager named <a href=# rel=noopener>Daniel LaPlante</a>, whom Tina had briefly dated, and he had been living in the family’s crawl space for several weeks, taunting them all the while.</p><p>Unfortunately, this creepy story doesn’t end here.</p><p>LaPlante would later go on to brutally murder a young teacher and her two children while he was out on bail for the Bowen family incident.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-444602 alt="Daniel LaPlante" width=449 height=497 data-sizes="(max-width: 449px) 100vw, 449px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/laplante-hiding-place.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-444602 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Steve Bezanson, Tom Lane</span><span class=caption-body>A police sketch of Daniel LaPlante’s hiding place while he was phrogging in the Bowen home.</span></p><p>At first, LaPlante only planned to burglarize the home of the Gustafson family in November and December 1987, but he was caught off guard on December 1st when Priscilla Gustafson and her children came home early.</p><p>LaPlante later said that he had considered jumping out the window and escaping, but instead he opted to confront Priscilla, aiming a gun at her and leading her and her five-year-old son William to a bedroom. There, he forced William into a closet and tied Priscilla to a bed, gagging her with a sock.</p><p>He raped Priscilla, then shot her twice in the head. Afterward, he took William into the bathroom and drowned him, and when seven-year-old Abigail Gustafson returned home just as LaPlante was leaving, he led the young girl to another bathroom and drowned her too.</p><p>LaPlante was easily linked to the crime scene, and subsequently arrested just two days later. During his trial in October 1988, a jury found him guilty of murder, and he was sentenced to three life sentences.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyxtNGonqChnpw%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./adin-ross.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Adin Ross Net Worth, Age, Girlfriend, Family, Biography &amp;amp; More</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./10-kids-tv-shows-that-are-actually-great-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>10 Kids Shows That Are Actually Great</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
