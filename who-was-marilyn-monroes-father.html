She was born Norma Jeane Mortenson on June 1, 1926. She died on August 4, 1962. She was known for playing funny “blonde bombshell” roles, which made her one of the most popular s*x symbols of the 1950s and early 1960s.</p><p>She also became a symbol of the sexual revolution of that time. She was the most popular actress for ten years, and by the time she died in 1962, her movies had made $200 million, which is the same as $2 billion in 2021.</p><p>Monroe is still a big part of pop culture long after she died. In 1999, the American Film Institute put her at number six on its list of the best female stars from Hollywood’s Golden Age. In 2009, The Guardian said that she was one of the best actors who had never been nominated for an Academy Award.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Who Were Marilyn’s Mom And Dad?</h2><p>Gladys Baker, who was 26 at the time, gave birth to Marilyn, whose real name was<strong> Norma Jeane</strong>, on June 1, 1926. Marilyn went to live with a foster family when she was only two weeks old, but Gladys went to see her often over the years. She also tried to get full-time custody of her daughter, but her Biography says she was diagnosed with schizophrenia and struggled with its symptoms</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100% rel=noopener>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none rel=noopener>A post shared by Marilyn Monroe (@marilynmonroe)</a></p></figure><p>No one knew for a long time who Marilyn’s father was, but there were many ideas.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Did Gladys Say About Her&nbsp;Dad?</h2><p>Source says that at one point, Gladys told Marilyn that her father, <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Charles Stanley Gifford</a>, was one of her coworkers and her boss at RKO Studios. Gladys worked for Charles when <a href=#>she got pregnant</a>.</p><p>Source says that Gladys showed Marilyn a picture of a man in a frame and told her that he was her father.</p><p>Martin Edward Mortensen, who used to be married to Gladys, is listed as Marilyn’s father on her birth certificate. However, based on when Mortensen and Gladys broke up, The Cinemaholic and Marca say it’s likely he didn’t father the child.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What Happened To Marilyn Monroe’s Father?</h2><p>Charles Stanley Gifford was born in 1898 and died in 1965 when he was 66 years old. He worked as a salesman for movies at Consolidated Films, where he met Gladys, Marilyn’s mother. Later in life, he reportedly owned some cottage apartments. In his later years, in the 1960s, he was said to have owned and run Red Rock Dairy, which sold ice cream and baked goods.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/thecurrent-online.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/image-5-1024x576.png><p>People say that when Marilyn was in the area, she would have her driver take her through the Red Rock drive-through and force her father, who had left her before she was born, to fill her order.</p><p>Marilyn’s ex-husband said in a 1996 documentary called “Marilyn Monroe: The Mortal Goddess” that Marilyn tried to get in touch with Charles before she was famous, but he wasn’t interested in getting to know her.</p><p>James Dougherty said, “She got on the phone, looked up his number, and called him.” “He didn’t know who she was, so he told her, “No, I don’t know who you are.” See my lawyer.” Her ex-husband said that the actress was “really sad” after the conversation and that her father “missed a good chance.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>How Old Was Marilyn Monroe When She Died?</h2><p>She was 36 years old when she died.</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>Who is Josefa Salinas?
