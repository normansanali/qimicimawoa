Shilo Sanders was born to Deion Sanders and Pilar Sanders. Deion Sanders is an American football coach and former professional football and baseball player.</p><p>Hailing from Canton, Texas, Shilo Sanders attended Trinity Christian High School, where he showcased his exceptional skills. During his high school career, he proved to be a versatile player, recording 24 tackles, one pass deflection, five interceptions, and a fumble recovery on defense. On the offensive end, he rushed for 45 yards and a touchdown and made 13 receptions for 199 yards and three touchdowns.</p><p>Shilo Sanders faced a pivotal decision when it came to choosing a college football program. Despite receiving offers from 14 other schools, he committed to the University of South Carolina.

He delivered a standout performance with ten tackles in a pivotal victory over Auburn. By the end of the shortened 2020 season, he had amassed 32 tackles, including one for a loss, and a pass deflection.
