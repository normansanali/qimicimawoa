However, they both believed that this TV program, which is an experiment, would encourage them to give their marriage another shot.</p><p>Are they still together now? How about Alexis’ employment? Does she have a new man in her life? As this bio progresses, discover all the answers.</p><h3><strong>The Big D: Are Alexis Nicole And Devon Wright Still Together?</strong></h3><p>Alexis Nicole and Devon Wright were married for a year and got divorced. Unfortunately, Alexis and Devon’s separation wasn’t due to a lack of romance. After a year of marriage, their connection with their in-laws became strained, and Devon’s propensity for escalating arguments caused them to split up.</p><p>The couple made the decision to divorce due to pressure from others on their union. They experienced a lot of pressure from their in-laws to behave in a specific way throughout the brief time that they were married to each other. While family members undoubtedly contributed to their disunity, Alexis also believed Devon was a constant source of arguments and made it impossible for them to do almost everything.</p><p>“My mom definitely meddled in our relationship. She was texting him rude, long messages,” Alexis shared. It would eventually develop to the point where Devon and her mother would communicate back and forth via messaging, voicemail, and blocking. Even in person, the conflict would escalate and create an uncomfortable situation. She claimed that her mother frequently told her that Devon was not the right match for her.</p><p>Regarding the reason they had to get a divorce, he explained, “It just&nbsp;got to a point in time where&nbsp;things got really toxic. After two years of divorce, have they given up on one another?</p><p>After only a little over a year of marriage, the couple ultimately made the decision to separate. They can explore new possibilities, but also put the past behind them and find common ground by participating in “The Big D.”</p><p>In the video, Alexis is heard telling Devon that she will think a lot about him by the time the event is over. Since they weren’t able to live their lives together without interruption, they both seem to be interested in a second opportunity. We’ll watch to see if they get back together or feel it’s not worthwhile to deal with external forces in their relationship. Dr. Jackson might have some wise counsel for them as they decide whether to stay together or move forward.</p><p>Did they able to mend their marriage after the show? Sadly no.
