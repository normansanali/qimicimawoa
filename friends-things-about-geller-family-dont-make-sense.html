Friends was a hit TV show in the 90s that was focused on a group of six adults in their late 20s, trying to navigate through life in New York City when it came to dating, friendship, employment, and more. The Geller family added a lot of interesting moments to the show.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=p1>If it wasn’t for the hilarious Geller parents on friends, we wouldn’t understand why Ross and Monica turned out the way that they did. There are a few things about this family unit they don’t really make a lot of sense. For example, the fact that Monica dated one of her dad’s best friends is super weird. Most families cannot relate to a situation as awkward as that.

That’s why it’s so weird and interesting that Jack and Judy Geller made it obvious that they prefer Ross over Monica.
