At 5’3″, he was the shortest player to ever play in the National Basketball Association, and his&nbsp;career and life are truly something amazing&nbsp;and an inspiration to all.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Early Life and Career</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Before Mugsy made it to&nbsp;the NBA, he had his share of adversity growing up in the inner city projects of Baltimore. The 8-time NBA All-Star spilled the beans on his autobiography, In the Land of Giants, released back in 1994 in which he tells ALL about how he clawed his way outta those filthy mean streets tinto NBA Heaven. At every level, Muggsy was told he was too small to play, but with a never-ending sense of self-belief and heart, his talent in the end won the day.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>NBA Career</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Muggsy spent 14 seasons in the NBA, playing as a point guard for the Washington Bullets, Charlotte Hornets, Golden State Warriors, and Toronto Raptors. He played ten seasons with his primary team — the Charlotte Hornets. An uncharacteristically large shot blocker for his size—Mugsy was able to hang with NBA greats throughout his career, never backing down from a challenge or a defensive matchup.&nbsp;</p><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>Career Statistics<br data-mce-fragment=1>Points: 6,858 (7.7 ppg)<br data-mce-fragment=1>Assists: 6,726 (7.6 apg)<br data-mce-fragment=1>Steals: 1,369 (1.5 SPG)</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Overcoming the Odds</h2><p>Muggsy's outstanding career was an example of him being able to turn his doubters into more fuel for his competitive drive. Years marked by hardship and tragedy, as during 1993, but all of it was less significant in Muggsy's life — his love of the game fueled him past grief and weariness to a world of success on the court.</p><h2>Impact and Legacy</h2><p>Muggsy made an impression in the game that was not encapsulated by his stats. He was known for his blazing speed, quickness, and box-out defense. "Everything starts with Muggsy here," said his teammate Larry Johnson. Ultimately, he is the touchstone. He is the spark plug." His legacy is not based on numbers alone, but also what he dis to help motivate people to defy their circumstances and reach for the stars.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Life After Basketball</h2><p>After the end of his NBA career, Muggsy kept working in the basketball world and he was head coach of the WNBA's Charlotte Sting as well as becoming head coach of the United Faith Christian Academy boys' high school basketball team back at his hometown in Charlotte, North Carolina. Off the court, Bogues made major contributions as well, such as starting his foundation — The Muggsy Bogues Family Foundation — to help vocationally-bound students with scholarships and community outreach programs for at-risk families.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>In the End</h2><p><br data-mce-fragment=1>He symbolizes more than just a basketball player; he is a beacon of perseverance, determination and never giving up. He Was The Shortest NBA Player Ever And Still Made It —&nbsp;as he continues to inspire us today and build his enduring legacy on and off the court. The story of Muggsy Bogues is a testament to the knowledge that no matter how high the odds seem, if one believes in themselves&nbsp;and gets a little help along the way,&nbsp;they&nbsp;can overcome absolutely anything.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0milm5lfmbKnxcinnmasmJp6sLDDrGSmrZecwLp5waierp2jYsGpsYysn6iqpJrAtXnPpZiynaJitq95zZuYZqCZqMGwvtg%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./dolly-partons-honest-quotes-about-plastic-surgery-through-the-years.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Dolly Partons Honest Quotes About Plastic Surgery Through The Years</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-huawei-mate-8-review.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Conclusion &amp;amp; End Remarks - The Huawei Mate 8 Review</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
