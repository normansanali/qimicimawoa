Since 2007 they have been known as Machel Montano HD (High Definition); Montano promotes the concept by saying that he is the first human being to go HD. He claims this characterizes the evolution of his music over the past 25 years and the highly improved style in which his music is presented to his fans in radio format, television, and during live performances. He is part of a campaign in Trinidad and Tobago to promote safe driving – “Arrive Alive”. Part of the hype surrounding Montano since 2007 is his HD tour bus, a 20-year-old bus from the Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC) that was re-done and includes a bedroom, bathroom facilities, flat-screen TVs, Internet access and expensive audio systems. After its debut in 2007, the bus was re-painted for 2008, the new images of Machel matching various photos from the album artwork of his 2008 CD, Flame On. The bus featured heavily in his videos for “Jumbie” (2007) and “Rollin/Blazin d Trail” (2008). In 2012 Montano won the Road March, Power Soca Monarch and the Groovy Soca Monarch, thanks in large part to his business and personal manager, James Walton. He won the Groovy Soca Monarch with his rendition of “Mr. Fete”. In May 2012 he launched the music video to his hit single “Bottle Of Rum”. Mr. Walton helped launch merchandise, collaborations and reality shows to help catapult Montano’s career to new heights.</p><h2>Machel Montano Net Worth</h2><p align=justify>Machel Montano is one of the <strong>richest World Music Singer</strong> from Trinidad and Tobago.
