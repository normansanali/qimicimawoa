Team Rocket was stopped thanks to the Heracross and the Pinsir were able to return to their forest, leaving the <a href=# title="Butterfree (Pokémon)">Butterfree</a> and Heracross. However, the same Heracross was still intrigued by Ash and followed him out of the forest. Eventually, Ash saw him following and the Heracross happily allowed himself to be caught.</p><p>Heracross's battle debut came in <i><a href=# title=EP120>Roll On, Pokémon!</a></i>, where he battled one of <a href=# title=Rochelle>Rochelle</a>'s <a href=# title="Donphan (Pokémon)">Donphan</a>, easily outclassing it before the battle was interrupted. Although he lost a subsequent battle to her most experienced Donphan, Ash was satisfied that he had gained significant battle experience.</p><p>He scored a significant victory over <a href=# title=Nickname>Blade</a>, <a href=# title=Shingo>Shingo</a>'s <a href=# title="Scizor (Pokémon)">Scizor</a>, in <i><a href=# title=EP140>Wired for Battle!</a></i>. He initially had trouble with his <a href=# title="Leer (move)">Leer</a> attack being ineffective when Blade used <a href=# title="Quick Attack (move)">Quick Attack</a>. However, Heracross's reaction time of 0.18 gave him the advantage over Scizor's claws, and he soon learned to anticipate Blade's movements. Shingo abandoned his laptop analytics and began to order Blade's battle, where the two proved to be very powerful. However, Heracross managed to dodge Blade's Quick Attack, knocked it off balance when it attempted a <a href=# title="False Swipe (move)">False Swipe</a> and finished Blade off with <a href=# title="Horn Attack (move)">Horn Attack</a>.</p><a href=# class=image><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/archives.bulbagarden.net/media/upload/thumb/f/f8/Ash_Heracross_Gary_Magmar.png/330px-Ash_Heracross_Gary_Magmar.png decoding=async width=220 height=165 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> Defeating Magmar with Megahorn<p>Heracross was sent to <a href=# title="Professor Oak (anime)">Professor Oak</a>'s lab in <i><a href=# title=EP146>Tricks of the Trade</a></i> in exchange for one of <a href=# title="Ash's Tauros">Ash's Tauros</a>.

Heracross fought Magmar regardless of the <a href=# title=Type>type</a> disadvantage, sending Magmar flying with Fury Attack. Magmar launched a three-pronged attack - <a href=# title="Fire Blast (move)">Fire Blast</a>, a point-blank <a href=# title="Flamethrower (move)">Flamethrower</a>, and its own body weight from the fall. However, Heracross overcame the flames by beating them away with his wings. He then broke through Magmar's defense with Megahorn, taking out the Spitfire Pokémon. However, <a href=# title="Gary's Blastoise">Blastoise</a> proved to be a harder challenge, firing a <a href=# title="Hydro Pump (move)">Hydro Pump</a> powerful enough to blow away Heracross's rock cover and take him out of the battle.</p><h4><span id=Pok.C3.A9mon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire_and_Pok.C3.A9mon_Chronicles></span><span class=mw-headline id=Pokémon_the_Series:_Ruby_and_Sapphire_and_Pokémon_Chronicles><i><a href=# title="Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire">Pokémon the Series: Ruby and Sapphire</a></i> and <a href=# title="Pokémon Chronicles">Pokémon Chronicles</a></span></h4><p>In <i><a href=# title=HS04>Showdown at the Oak Corral</a></i>, Heracross warned the other Pokémon about <a href=# title=Cassidy>Cassidy</a> and <a href=# title=Butch>Butch</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG133>The Right Place and the Right Mime</a></i>, Heracross met and shook hands with <a href=# class=mw-redirect title="Ash's Grovyle">Grovyle</a> during Ash's brief return to <a href=# title="Pallet Town">Pallet Town</a>.</p><p>In <i><a href=# title=AG164>Ka Boom with a View!</a></i>, Ash used Heracross in the battle against <a href=# title=Spenser>Spenser</a>.
