So I don’t want to speak too much on it, but yeah, it’s pretty incredible.”</p><p>The couple confirmed their romance on October 6 with a cozy Instagram selfie after <a href=#>first teasing their pairing</a> in May.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Torrey-DeVitto-Gushes-That-Her-Relationship-With-Boyfriend-Will-Estes-Is-Incredible.jpg><p>DeVitto told Us that she and the Blue Bloods actor, 42, bonded over their dedication to activism. “For me, it’s like, in this day and age, I feel like it’s that same way with my friends,” she explained. “It’s like, with the way the world is going, for me personally, I don’t think I’d be able to connect with somebody who didn’t have a passion of either giving back or wanting to use their good to help the world in whatever way they could. You know what I mean?”</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>Pretty Little Liars</a>&nbsp;alum then elaborated on the intersection of advocacy and relationships. “We’re in such dire times that it’s like, if you can turn a blind eye to anything that’s going on with the planet, with other human beings, with animals, then to me, it’s like, I don’t know that there would be much for me to connect on because I feel like we’re in such dire straits right now that it’s like, it’s important for me in my friendships or relationships or anything to kind of bond over that want to contribute in any way you feel that’s best for you,” she continued.</p><p>DeVitto even went so far as to say that the matter is a <a href=#>dating deal-breaker</a> for her. “If you go on a date with someone and you’re like, ‘So what do you think of everything?’ And they go, ‘I don’t know. I don’t really care. I guess it is the way it is.’ It’s like, ‘OK, check please!’” she said.</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href=#>One Tree Hill</a>&nbsp;alum certainly practices what she preaches. The Tote Project has teamed up with her and SafeBAE to educate kids in the foster care system about consent, bystander invention and safe relationships to prevent children from being trafficked. Five dollars from every sale of the signature Torrey DeVitto tote and pouch will be donated to SafeBAE to fund a foster care-focused breakout session during the organization’s 2020 Virtual Summit. The Tote Project and DeVitto are launching two new products with the theme Free to Blossom featuring exclusive artwork, her profile and her handwritten custom phrase.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Torrey-DeVitto-Free-to-Blossom_Tote.jpg><p>“[Free to Blossom] kind of just stuck because I think a lot of times when you’re dealing with survivors, to give them the permission to blossom into who they are and become themselves and not identify with what happened to them,” the actress told&nbsp;Us. “I think that phrase itself just was so beautiful.”</p><p>With reporting by Kayley Stumpe</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatp6Knsrp5w56toqykpHquxYyrnKWZpJ68r7%2FHoqdmr5mptW7DyKWjZp2jqbK0ecisZKKmk6eypbXBpZxo</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./what-did-krum-do-to-fleur-in-the-maze.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>What did Krum do to Fleur in the maze?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./stephen-sondheim-london-theaters-to-pay-tribute-by-dimming-lights.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Stephen Sondheim: London Theaters to Pay Tribute by Dimming Lights</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
