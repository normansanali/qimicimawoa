Get To Know The Filmmaker<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chef Naushad is widely recognized by the name of&nbsp;Naushad Big Chef. Here is the exact location of his catering service – National Highway Bypass Rd, Vyttila, Thammanam, Kochi, Kerala.</p><p>Most probably, the restaurant has some COVID-19 restrictions. Also, after Naushad fell ill, we believe the service is temporarily unavailable.</p><p>Moreover, he is a respected filmmaker in India. Well, he had once worked as an actor in the 2010 movie, Best Actor.</p><p>According to&nbsp;IMDb, he has been credited in at least 6 shows as a producer. Indeed, his works will forever remain in the heart of all the Malayalam people.</p><p>Moving on, recent internet rumors say that Naushad has passed away. However, the news is not true at this point.</p><p>India Glitz&nbsp;reported that the chef was admitted at&nbsp;Thiruvalla Hospital. Reportedly, he is in a critical condition and is under ventilator support.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=is-chef-naushad-on-wikipedia></span>Is Chef Naushad on Wikipedia?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chef Naushad is one of the personalities who deserve a Wikipedia page. However, his profile has not been set up yet.</p><p>Nevertheless, we can find him on Facebook. Reportedly, his page has accumulated over 667 followers.</p><p>Moreover, Naushad is active on Instagram as @chef_naushadd. Well, he has earned nearly 100 followers on the platform.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chef-naushad-wife-is-he-married></span>Chef Naushad Wife: Is He Married?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Chef Naushad lost his&nbsp;<strong>wife</strong>&nbsp;two weeks ago. Indeed, her demise is also a major reason behind his hampered health.</p><p>Multiple reports claim that the couples have a daughter. Well, their child is going through a lot at the moment.</p><p>Losing a life partner is the saddest thing that can happen to a person. Despite being a happy personality, Naushad couldn’t take the weight of his spouse’s death.</p><p>Hopefully, Naushad will find the strength to overcome his illness. We pray for his family at this difficult time.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=chef-naushad-death-cause-did-he-really-die></span>Chef Naushad Death Cause: Did He Really Die?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>There’s nothing to know about Chef Naushad’s death cause. His critical condition might lead to his passing anytime soon.</p><p>We are well aware that most patients under ventilators do not survive. So, many fans and followers are extremely sad that the chef will pass away.</p><p>However, we can be hopeful as Naushad is a strong personality. We would like to request everyone to provide his family with the privacy and space they deserve.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYpHqqv4ycn56eXaOutr%2FHmptmr5mgtrGxw6KYZpmemXqlscCtn2abkarApns%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./meet-zach-nichelman-natasha-alexis-martinez-boyfriend.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Who Is Natasha Alexis Martinez Boyfriend, Zach Nichelman?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-has-shadeur-sanders-signed-nil-deals-with.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who has Shadeur Sanders signed NIL deals with?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
