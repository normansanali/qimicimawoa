And thank you to the community of #Canarsie for your overwhelming support as we painted this memorial mural. We are humbled and honored.”</p><p>This unfortunately isn’t the first time vandals have decorated Pop Smoke tributes.

I’m sitting on the bed and I’m starting to take off my clothes, and he said: ‘OK, I’ll come back,’” she recalled. “He was going to the restroom and so these were his last words.”</p><p>“This moment, it was like a couple seconds and I hear the noise,” Rose continued as she described hearing a sliding glass door open into the second-story bedroom. “The guy was in the mask and his gun was like… ‘Look at me,’ you know? His eyes made me so scared. They run to the restroom.
