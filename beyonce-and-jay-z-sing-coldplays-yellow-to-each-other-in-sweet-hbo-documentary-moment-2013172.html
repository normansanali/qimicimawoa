The 31-year-old singer and Jay-Z, 43, are out celebrating her pregnancy in the heart-warming scene, a happy occasion that Beyonce says came after the heartbreak of a previous miscarriage.</p><p>“It was the saddest thing I’ve ever been through,” she said of her previous short-lived pregnancy at one point in the film. “My life is a journey … I had to go through the miscarriage, I believe I had to go through owning my company and managing myself … ultimately your independence comes from knowing who you are and you being happy with yourself.”</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt='Beyonce "Life Is But A Dream"' width=476 height=287 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>“About two years ago, I was pregnant for the first time,” the Grammy winner continued. “And I heard the heartbeat, which was the most beautiful music I ever heard in my life.”&nbsp;</p><p>The “Love on Top” singer said she and Jay-Z had even begun to pick out names when they received the bad news after going to the doctor for a check-up.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I went into the studio and wrote the saddest song I’ve ever written in my life,” she expained. “And it was actually the first song I wrote for my alb. It was the best form of therapy for me, because it was the saddest thing I’ve ever been through.”</p><p>Happily for the singer, however, Beyonce welcomed baby <strong>Blue Ivy</strong> on Jan. 7, 2012, whom she called her “homey” in a <a href=#>March 2013 Vogue interview</a>.</p><p>“Being pregnant was very much like falling in love,” she said of the intensity of her love for her now-13-month-old daughter. “You are so open. You are so overjoyed. There’s no words that can express having a baby growing inside of you, so of course you want to scream it out and tell everyone.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnamku6SxjJqlnWWalsZuxoysoKefXZi8rbDPpZiyq12usq24zrBkraddmq6ktIyoq6GdomK2r3nSsJyerF2dr7B5w6iarqWVo8GivthmpKillaPBbn6Pampqb2Jk</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./bret-hart-is-married-to-wife-stephanie-washington-past-relationships-519297-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Bret Hart is Married to Wife: Stephanie Washington.
