Dondinho and Celeste named their son after the great inventor Thomas Edison.</p><p>As the years went by, Edson’s friends nicknamed him Pele after the Vasco da Gama goalkeeper, Bile. Although the names don’t match, it was initially a way of teasing Edson due to mispronunciation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pele-Early-Life-Source-Biography.jpg><p>Moreover, Pele, as a kid, was struck by poverty. To earn a living, he would work as a servant.</p><p>He first came to admire soccer through his father. Unable to collect money to buy a soccer ball, he would wrap newspaper in socks and tie them with a string.</p><p>With an innate passion, Pele first joined amateur sides like Sete de Setembro, Canto do Rio, São Paulinho, and Amériquinha; later, the Brazilian player sharpened his skills.</p><h2>Soccer Career Salary & Incomes</h2><p>Historically speaking, no soccer player of the 21st century can manage to rule over Pele’s throne. Only Lionel&nbsp;Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo are closer to challenging the Brazilian milestone with a seemingly unbreakable record.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Pele-football.jpg><p>Another milestone he set was scoring the most soccer goals for a single club, Santos FC.</p><p>The icon played for two decades at Santos FC throughout his career, and upon nearing his retirement, he moved to New York Cosmos and played for three full seasons.</p><p>With a highlight of a 37-year-long career, Pele amassed a <strong>$15 million</strong> sum.</p><p>Declaring a national treasure by the then Brazilian President only boosted his reputation and significantly bumped his paycheck.</p><p>While this may be true, the actual salary Santos FC paid Pele is not available to the public. When the Brazilian national treasure started playing for New York Cosmos, he pocketed almost <strong>$6 million</strong> by the end of his contract.</p><p>Pele earned nearly<strong> $14 million</strong> through endorsement deals & About <strong>$15 million</strong> from soccer .</p><p>The amount he earned during his playing career might seem pale on present-age soccer contracts and wages, but let us remind you he was the highest-paid athlete accounting for every sport.</p><h2>Pele | Jersey</h2><p>Pele wore jersey number 10 for the Brazilian national team and a few other clubs. Since the legend of soccer wore the number, number 10 is important in Brazil and different places.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pele-Jersey-Number-Source-El-Futbolero-Ecuador.jpg><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Neymar</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Ronaldinho</a> also inherited the same number.
