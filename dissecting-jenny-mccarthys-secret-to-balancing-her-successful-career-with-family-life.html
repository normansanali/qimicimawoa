She has worked as a model, actress, satellite radio broadcaster, television host, and actress. In her own little way, she is also a spokeswoman for autism-inclined foundations as well as an author. Indeed, she has successfully made a name for herself, her background notwithstanding.</p><p>Did I mention that Jenny is a wife and a mother? She is married to the Blue Bloods star, Donnie Wahlberg, and her son, Evan, has inspired her full involvement with the affairs of kids suffering from autism, following his diagnosis a few years after his birth. She has reached out to a lot of autism advocacy foundations through several mediums and has oftentimes taken to different TV shows to air her views about the condition. Jenny is one strong woman who inspires a lot out there, valiantly balancing her busy schedule with the homefront.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-jenny-mccarthy-strikes-a-perfect-work-home-balance></span><strong>How Jenny McCarthy Strikes A Perfect Work-Home Balance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Jenny McCarthy got her start as a Playboy bunny, co-hosted many TV shows, has written numerous books, and has long been vocal about her anti-vaccination beliefs. Granted, you may not agree with some of her ideas but you can learn one or two things from her, especially as it regards work-home balance.</p><p>Despite her busy and almost insane schedule, Jenny has found a way to strike a balance between all that matters to her; work and home. The wife of Donnie Wahlberg thankfully has great support from her husband and family. As she shuttles between hosting her own show The Jenny McCarthy Show on SiriusXM, being a judge on Fox’s The Masked Singer, activism, marriage, and parenting, Jenny has a few rules to help her balance family life with the spotlight.</p><p>Together with her husband, she enforces a strict five-day rule, promising to go no more than one week without spending time at home with the family, even if it means traveling multiple times a week to meet the rule. Another rule she enforces is saying “no.” As hard as it is to turn down opportunities, she has learned how to just say “no” if it takes away from her family too much.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-she-met-and-married-donnie-wahlberg></span><strong>How She Met and Married Donnie Wahlberg</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Their love story could be best described as unexpected especially when McCarthy didn’t think romance was in her future after her first marriage hit the rocks. Being a single mom, she feared not finding the right person, but then, Donnie Wahlberg came along and eliminated her fears.</p><p>On his own part, Donnie, himself a divorced dad of two, didn’t have lofty expectations either. The couple first met in 2012 when they both appeared as guests on Watch What Happens: Live, with Andy Cohen as their chaperone. However, it was in 2013 that they literally walked into each other’s life; Wahlberg was a guest on the VH1 talk show Jenny had at the time. He asked her out two “long” weeks after and since then, the pair just can’t get enough of each other.</p><p>As the seconds ticked down in 2013, the celebrity duo started what would be their annual tradition of ringing in the new year with a big, dramatic kiss in Times Square. In their first thanksgiving as a couple, they also launched one tradition that has existed since then: French’s green bean casserole.</p>In April 2014, just over a year after they met, Wahlberg popped the big question and of course, McCarthy said “yes.” they didn’t bother with a long engagement as they tied the knots four months later on August 31, 2014, at the Hotel Baker in St. Charles with Evan, Jenny’s son walking her down the aisle. In January 2015, they took their relationship to reality TV with A&E’s Donnie Loves Jenny, with a wedding episode. the series lasted three seasons. Six years and countdown to forever, the couple have remained a perfect hit.<p>Donnie is a singer and actor. He is a founding member of New Kids on the Block and has a role in the TV series Blue Bloods. He married Kim Fey in 1999 after eight years of dating. They had two sons together: Xavier and Elijah. Donnie and Kim mutually filed for divorce in 2008 and the split was finalized a year later.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=details-of-her-previous-marriage-to-john-asher></span><strong>Details of Her Previous Marriage to John Asher</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>It is fair to say that her professional life, Jenny has been constant and stable as she has participated in plenty of projects throughout her career. However, the same couldn’t be said of her romantic life. She has been married twice to two different men and recorded a number of romantic relationships including one with manager Ray Manzella in the 1990s and another with actor Jim Carrey from 2005 to 2010.</p><p>Her first husband was actor, director, and screenwriter, John Asher MacArthur. John is the son of actress Joyce Bulifant and actor, Edward Mallory. Following his mother’s remarriage to her third husband, producer, and director William Asher, he adopted John and gave him his last name, thus, John Asher. His mother was married five times to five different men.</p><p>Jenny and John were said to have dated for a while before settling as man and wife on the 11th day of September 1999. Their son, Evan Joseph Asher, was born on May 18, 2002. Trouble supposedly entered the paradise shortly after their son’s autism diagnosis. They subsequently couldn’t tolerate each other and called it quits after six years of marriage, in September 2005.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jenny-mccarthys-background></span><strong>Jenny McCarthy’s Background</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Anyone with poise in broadcasting at almost all times has the magnetic ability to spread exciting vibes to the world just like Jenny McCarthy. Born on November 1, 1972, into a working-class Roman Catholic family, the second of four daughters, Jenny’s career in the entertainment industry started shortly after quitting school, as she decided to take a walk in modeling.</p><p>She grew up with her sisters; Lynette, Joanne, and Amy at the West Elsdon neighborhood of Chicago. Jenny McCarthy is said to have a mixed ethnicity – Irish, German, and Polish. Her father made ends meet as a steel mill foreman while her mother worked as a courtroom custodian. Well, looks like she isn’t the only one with the entertainment vibes in her family; she holds a strong family tie with the illustrious actress, Melissa McCarthy.</p><p>The lady boss spent her educational years at Mother McAuley Liberal Arts High School and Southern Illinois University where she spent two years before dropping out, probably due to insufficient funds.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=mccarthys-rise-to-fame></span><strong>McCarthy’s Rise To Fame</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Shortly after leaving school, Jenny landed her first modeling gig with Playboy Magazine in 1993. Her work with Playboy was quite adventurous; she posed nude for their October 1993 edition for which she earned $20,000. In the same month, she was ranked as Miss October 1993 and was subsequently referred to as the Playmate of the Year in 1994.</p><p>Her deals with the magazine subsequently pushed her to the limelight. It was then that her career opened up the more. Producers noticed her outstanding talent and acts and immediately knew that she was talented enough to work on TV. Some of her first TV projects include co-hosting numerous television shows such as Singled Out, The View, Dirty, Sexy and Funny with Jenny McCarthy.</p><p>From that point on, she kept getting working on more TV shows and also bagged a few roles in both television drama series and in movies such as Basketball, Scream 3, Santa Bay, and more. Added to her co-hosting gigs, Jenny McCarthy is one of the panelists on The Masked Singer, which premiered on January 2, 2019. Meanwhile, she still has her modeling skills in check and is often given several platforms to demonstrate them.</p><p>While she was being lauded for effectively managing three different careers, Jenny proved what a superwoman she was and added author to her resume. She slammed the world with the release of her books and has written a lot mostly about her journey into and in motherhood. They include Belly Laughs: The Naked Truth about Pregnancy and Childbirth, Baby Laughs, <i>Louder than Words: A Mother’s Journey in Healing Autism</i>, Mother Warriors, Bad Habits, Healing&nbsp;and&nbsp;Preventing Autism.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=her-sons-health-struggles></span><strong>Her Son’s Health Struggles</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Jenny McCarthy may be popular for her co-hosting gig or even her days as a Playboy Playmate, however, the most important role for her is being an advocate for children with autism. She considers this singular role as her reason for being famous.</p><p>She is personally touched by autism as her son, Evan Asher is on the spectrum. He was diagnosed with autism at a very early age, in 2005. Like most parents whose children are on the spectrum, Jenny was dazed when she received her son’s diagnosis. In an interview she had with Oprah Winfrey in 2007, Jenny revealed that her son started having seizures and that, at some point, his heart stopped, and paramedics had to administer CPR.</p><p>When he was eventually diagnosed with autism, Jenny didn’t want to believe it. After she took in the shocking news, she learned that autism was in fact “reversible and treatable.” Consequently, she got hands-on with her son’s diet, behavioral therapy, and treatment. Her hard work has paid off. Evan, who is now a teenager has shown great improvements in his speech and sociability. He is passionate about animated films and videogames and has grown to be an excellent swimmer. He collaborated with two friends to launch his own YouTube channel about videogames named Gaming USA.</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/CDnkmywBRR3/</p><p>Evan’s condition was life-changing for Jenny. It inspired most of her writings, spurred her activism, and made her a subject of controversy. Jenny McCarthy is the board president and spokesperson of Generation Rescue, an autism advocacy foundation she founded. She has also drawn controversy for her views on children being vaccinated, something she has linked to her son’s autism.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=jenny-has-become-the-face-of-the-anti-vax-movement></span><strong>Jenny has become the face of the anti-vax movement</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>In 2007, the Masked Singer judge claimed that vaccinations played a role in her son’s condition, and launched a controversial public movement regarding vaccines. As per her reports, Evan was born a normal child and grew like every other child until his diagnosis in May 2005 after getting the MMR vaccination.</p><p>The actress has promoted the idea that vaccines may be linked to increased incidence of autism, an argument that has been scientifically unsubstantiated. Jenny McCarthy has since reiterated her stand stating that she does not lead an anti-vaccine movement and is “pro-vaccine, but pro–safe vaccine schedule.” She advocates for a delayed vaccination schedule that spreads out shots over time, an idea the CDC has warned against, positing that delayed vaccination can only endanger the child and may even lead to death. Notwithstanding, Jenny has continued to lend her voice to the “safe vaccine” movement.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyZqMCmr9OipaBlmpq7r8WMppqcmaKptbq%2FjKycnKqVqXq1u4ybmKWZnpi2r7OMoZyrZaOqsKSx0qydrqRdmK6zscSrZLChpJ16p63MoqOyZZyes6Z7</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./whats-love-got-to-do-with-it-how-much-are-the-stars-of-the-film-worth-today-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Much Are the Stars of the Film Worth Today?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./did-uncle-jesse-really-sing-forever.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Did Uncle Jesse really sing forever?
