Tushar Atre, 50, was found dead on October 1, 2019, by investigators from the Santa Cruz County Sheriff’s Office.&nbsp;Atre was shot and stabbed at the crest of the Santa Cruz Mountains near his cannabis field on Soquel San Jose Road. In July, the murder trial of Tushar Atre, a tech and cannabis businessman, was reopened in Santa Cruz Superior Court.</p><p>This happened more than three years after four people were charged with the murder of the Pleasure Point entrepreneur, which was allegedly a botched robbery. Tushar Atre’s terrible kidnapping and murder are the focus of an episode of Investigation Discovery’s 48 Hours, which is part of the show’s 18th season.&nbsp;The episode, which broadcast on January 9, 2023, at 10 p.m. ET, delves into the tragic events that occurred in October 2019. Despite the horrible nature of the crime, this occurrence exposes the tragic loss of life and stresses the steadfast pursuit of justice. As a result, the public’s interest in Tushar Atre and his family has risen.</p><h2>Tushar Atre’s Parents: Where Do They Come From?</h2><p>Following the heartbreaking Tushar Atre case, there is a rising interest in learning more about his parents and ancestry. Atre’s family information has remained confidential, keeping his background unknown.&nbsp;The horrific kidnapping, murder, and subsequent investigation highlight the gravity of the crime, while his professional achievements provide insight into his life. He rose to prominence as a tech billionaire and the founder of AtreNet Inc., a digital marketing organization located in Santa Cruz.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tushar-Atre-1.jpg alt="Tushar Atre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Furthermore, Atre was engaged in the development of therapeutic cannabis products via his Soquel San Jose Road firm in Santa Cruz.&nbsp;Atre was kidnapped from his beach home, seen on security video, and forcefully removed by intruders in a shocking turn of events.&nbsp;Visitors to Atre’s home reported hearing people asking for a safe, followed by a commotion.&nbsp;Despite this, officials found no evidence of forced entry or a hunt for goods.</p><p>During the inquiry, it was discovered that $80,000 was hidden in a bedroom safe, which the intruders were unable to open.&nbsp;More CCTV video showed Atre escaping along a street in his neighborhood, his hands shackled.&nbsp;His life was violently snatched, and his remains were discovered near his place of work, revealing traces of significant violence such as several knife wounds and a lethal gunshot.</p><h2>Tushar Atre Family Background: Upbringing And Ethnicity</h2><p>As previously said, nothing is known about Tushar Atre’s family, ethnicity, and upbringing since little information about them has been revealed.&nbsp;However, information regarding his girlfriend, who is significant in the context of his murder case, is accessible.&nbsp;Tushar Atre, 50, had a strong bond with his partner, Rachael Emerlye, who was both his personal companion and business partner.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Tushar-Atre-2.jpg alt="Tushar Atre" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Their love relationship was inextricably linked to their shared business ventures. Rachael Emerlye, Tushar Atre’s girlfriend at the time, drew notice because of her relationship with him.&nbsp;Nonetheless, thorough information on her is scarce. She was well-known for running the cannabis company Benevolent Bound.&nbsp;Despite being long-distance, their love lasted because they placed a significant focus on secrecy, refusing to announce any marital plans.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGirrquYlr9urdOrnGavmaC2bsPHqGSaqpVitaq%2FjKmYq52eqcBusdOhpaKbmanGbq3NnWSoqpmctq97</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./victoria-caro-height-weight-net-worth-age-wiki-who-instagram-biography-38948-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Victoria Caro Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Wiki, Who, Instagram, Biography</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./ladies-of-the-wood-whispering-hillock-ghost-tree-spirit-downwarren-answer-help-believe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Witcher 3 Ladies of the Wood guide and walkthrough</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
