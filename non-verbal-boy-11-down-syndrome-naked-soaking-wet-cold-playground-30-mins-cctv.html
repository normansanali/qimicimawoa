He then got himself wet while playing with water and decided to take his clothes off.</p><p>When&nbsp;the staff found him naked, they took him to another classroom before escorting him out into the playground with just a towel wrapped around his shoulders.&nbsp;</p><p>Cole said that she had no idea about what happened to her son and only came to know about the incident a day later after a witness described seeing Blackshaw cold and crying in the playground.</p><p>"When I found out, I was just crying. I went into the school and I nearly smashed the classroom up. My partner had to get the social workers and I had to be removed from the building." she told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Liverpool Echo</a>.</p><p>"I demanded to see the CCTV footage from the headteacher and it took two weeks, and when we saw it I was crying and even he was crying."</p><p>She added: "It was awful. What's really hard is how can you prove how Levi was affected? He is non-verbal, he is not like us. He came home from school that evening and we didn't even know. You send them to school to be protected."</p><p>An investigation was launched against deputy head Cecilia Maxwell but she was allowed to return to the school. Eleven months later, she along with headteacher Anthony Roberts and assistant headteacher Helen Clements were&nbsp;suspended by the board members.</p><p>The school did stress that the suspension was not an indication that the individuals were guilty of any misconduct.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRopp%2Bjerex0ZuYpWWSpMZufZBmm6ivnmLAurrDq6amnV2jrqyxw2aqqJmbnruoedaeq2abn6GxbrzLmrCgqp%2Bqu6V5kmlkpqGeqHqkr9Ov</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./angel-mena.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Angel Mena</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./why-do-ufc-fighters-shave-their-chests.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Why do UFC fighters shave their chests?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
