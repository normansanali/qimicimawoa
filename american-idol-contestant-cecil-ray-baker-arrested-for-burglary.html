He was released on a $15,000 bond the same day.</p><p>The <a href=#>20-year-old musician</a> allegedly forced his way into Lopez’s house a few days prior and assaulted her after she refused to let him see her daughter, according to the police report obtained by Us on Monday, April 19.</p><p>Lopez claimed in the affidavit that Baker wouldn’t let her ex into the home, which led him to go to the locked back door and rip it open. Lopez accused the Texas native of <a href=#>pushing her</a> and said he “struck her in the face with a palm heel” before leaving.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/American-Idol-Contestant-Cecil-Ray-Arrested-Burglary-003.jpg><p><span>According to the file, Baker’s sister corroborated Lopez’s story, reportedly telling the police that she was an eyewitness to the incident.</span></p><p>“I’ve had enough. This is why victims never come forward bc y’all try so hard to tear them down. #dobetter #bebetter,” Lopez <a href=#>captioned a TikTok video on Sunday, April 18</a>.

Anything’s achievable.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lopez, however, <a href=#>claimed in another TikTok video in April</a> that Baker “cheated” on her and “chose the other girls over us,” leaving her with the baby.</p><p>“People aren’t who they always seem to be on TV. I’m tired of always being silenced,” she captioned the clip. “You even denied my daughter being yours #cheater #americanidol #fyp.”</p><p>Us Weekly has reached out to ABC for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapZWntqStzWagnaecYrCwutOeqq2Znql6pLHCoqNmqpGueqOtyp6pZpmip7K0wMSdZJ%2BnomKvtr7GpZirsV8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ansley-spinks-net-worth-287779.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ansley Spinks Net Worth</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./naked-jennifer-aniston-helps-ben-stiller.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>A Naked Jennifer Aniston Helps Out Ben Stiller</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
