How is the company's upcoming IPO impacting Tony Xu’s net worth?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marketrealist.com/data:image/webp;base64><p>DoorDash has finally priced its IPO at $102 per share, which is higher than its previously indicated price range. <a href=#>Tony Xu's company</a> is riding high on the demand for food delivery services amid the COVID-19 pandemic. The company has increased its market share considerably by following a solid strategy and leading an expansion following fund injection from its investors.&nbsp;</p><p>As DoorDash’s founder and largest shareholder, <a href=#>Tony Xu</a> is definitely expected to benefit from the rise in DoorDash’s IPO price. What is Tony Xu’s net worth and how did he become so successful?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">When is the DoorDash IPO?</h2><p>DoorDash has been in news for the past few days due to its <a href=#>much anticipated IPO</a>. The company is set to debut publicly on Dec. 9. DoorDash will trade on the NYSE under the ticker symbol "DASH." The company has priced its IPO at $102 per share, which is higher than its most recent target price range of $90–$95. DoorDash is cashing in on the increased appetite for its IPO. The stay-at-home trend amid the coronavirus pandemic has led to a surge in sales for the meal delivery app.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The company hasn’t turned a notable profit. However, that doesn’t stop it from getting a steep valuation. DoorDash is <a href=#>the category leader in the U.S. meal delivery market</a> with a 51 percent market share in October. Uber Eats is second with a 23 percent share.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">When did Tony Xu start DoorDash?</h2><p>DoorDash was founded in 2013 as Palo Alto Delivery by Tony Xu, Stanley Tang, Evan Moore, and Andy Fang with a vision to build a local on-demand food delivery business. DoorDash considers itself more of a logistics company than a food company. Apart from the founders, DoorDash has received institutional funding from a number of venture capital firms. The three largest contributors are Sequoia Capital of California, SoftBank Vision Fund of London, and GIC of Singapore.</p><p>DoorDash founder Tony Xu, who is also the CEO, is the largest owner of the company with a 4.6 percent stake. According to DoorDash’s latest IPO price, the company is valued at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">nearly $39 billion</a>. At 36 years old, Xu is a billionaire in his own right. At the indicated IPO price, his net worth will be around $1.8 billion.&nbsp;</p><p>Xu has worked hard to be successful. In 2018, he spoke to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">LA Times</a> about being an entrepreneur. He said, “every day, every year, there are things that will make you increasingly uncomfortable. If you’re willing to bear that uncertainty, I think you’ll find a lot of rewards and satisfaction from it. Typically, it’s when you experience discomfort that you grow.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Who is Tony Xu's wife?</h2><p>Tony Xu married his wife Patti soon after he launched DoorDash. They met at church and got married in 2013. The couple has a two-year-old daughter named Olivia. Xu makes sure to spend every Friday evening with his family. He also has date nights with his wife.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-gIvpCV jBUmSX">Where is Tony Xu from?</h2><p>Xu is a first-generation American who moved from Nanjing, China to the U.S. when he was five years old.&nbsp;His parents were a professor and a doctor. His father got a Ph.D. in aeronautical engineering from the University of Illinois, while his mother worked three jobs in the US.&nbsp;</p><p>Xu graduated with a degree in industrial engineering and operations research from the University of California. Then, he enrolled in the Stanford Graduate School of Business, where he met Evan Moore — one of DoorDash’s other co-founders.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae4psDRnpiloaOpe6S7zGinaKyfo8ZuxNRmpZ6sXay8s8DHaA%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ylan-noel-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ylan Noel Bio (Wiki)</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./who-was-yellowstones-melanie-olmstead-how-did-her-death-affect-the-show.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Who Was Yellowstone's Melanie Olmstead &amp;amp; How Did Her Death Affect The Show?</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
