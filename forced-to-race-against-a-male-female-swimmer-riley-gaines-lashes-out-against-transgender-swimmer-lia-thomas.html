And that next day we came back and the mood had shifted to where people were mad, the girls, you know, there were tears.”</p><p>In first place, Thomas swam finished at 4:33.24s, according to results&nbsp;published&nbsp;on <a href=#>swimmeetresults.tech</a>.

Riley Gaines said she felt uncomfortable changing in the same locker room as transgender swimmer Lia Thomas. “That’s not something we were forewarned about, which I don’t think is right in any means, changing in a locker room with someone who has different parts.

Gaines claimed at the time that forcing her to compete against Thomas was unjust and that most other female athletes she knew felt the same way. Gaines claimed she and her teammates were confident the NCAA wouldn’t allow Thomas to compete in the women’s national championships with unfair physical advantages like height, muscle mass, and heart and lung size after learning that Thomas had competed in the men’s division for the previous three seasons before making the transition to a woman.</p><p>Also Read|<a href=#>“Female athletes are not okay with this”: Riley Gaines denied trophy over transgender swimmer Lia Thomas</a></p><p>Also read| <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">“Four to six hour window where I cannot remember anything”: Mary-Sophie Harvey alleges being drugged at 2022 Swimming World C’ships</a></p><p>Do follow us on:&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Google News</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Facebook</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Instagram</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiemafAtb%2FPqKmtsl6YvK57xaipnJ2UYsGwedGamp5lkZyuqrrSrWSaZZ2WuaZ5xZ6kmqSVYsC4tcymnKtlop65psWMoJiippWoeq2t0qGcrGWfqsFurcaaoKerpGLBs63NrJ6eppSav26%2F1qKkpp2iYrmqrYytn6ilkah8</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./hoda-kotb-children-meet-hope-catherine-kotb-and-haley-joy-kotb.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Hoda Kotb children : Meet Hope Catherine Kotb and Haley Joy Kotb</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./dustin-johnson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Dustin Johnson Bio, Wiki, Age, CoronaVirus, Height, Parents, Wife, Married, Net Worth, Swing and Wit</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
