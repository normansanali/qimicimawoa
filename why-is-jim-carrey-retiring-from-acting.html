"I've done enough," the prolific comedic revealed in an interview, adding that he is "pretty serious" about retiring from acting.

But I’m retiring.” When asked whether he was being serious, he doubled down by saying, “I’m being fairly serious, yeah.” However, he went on to say that his desire to walk away from his profession is not yet definite.</p><p>“It depends. If the angels bring some sort of script that’s written in gold ink that says to me that it’s going to be really important for people to see, I might continue down the road. But I’m taking a break.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>He added, “I really like my quite life and I really like putting paint on canvas and I really love my spiritual life and I feel like – and this is something you might never hear another celebrity say as long as time exists – I have enough. I’ve done enough. I am enough.”</p><p>Although fans of the actor are used to him taking extended acting breaks, it appears he’s ready to throw in the towel. In just a few short years, he went from having largely disappeared from Hollywood to becoming the talk of the town once again, only to quickly decide to retire.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>This Disturbing History Of Jim Carrey’s Most Memorable ‘In Living Color’ Character</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=jim-carrey-wants-to-fulfill-things-he-rsquo-s-ignored>Jim Carrey Wants To Fulfill Things He’s Ignored</h2><p>At this point in his life, Jim Carrey made headlines for implying that he might retire from acting.

He spilled, “I gotta get out of here before I slap someone. Honestly, I feel like there’s so many things, because I’ve been so busy for so long, important things that I’ve ignored. Like, there’s 25 years of Mystery Science Theater I have to catch up on.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The actor added, “And there’s painting.

Some people blame him for playing a role in creating anti-vaccine sentiment in America back when he was dating Jenny McCarthy.</p><p>He has also been criticized for his comments about Will Smith slapping Chris Rock at the Oscars, which many feel was hypocritical considering that Jim Carrey <a href=#>once kissed a teenage Alicia Silverstone</a> at an awards show without her consent.</p><p>However, from Carrey's comments, his retirement has nothing to do with that drama.</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>The Reason Why We Don’t Hear About Jim Carrey Anymore</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuobFdnsButsimZJyZoqeyunnRnquiqpmjtG6y0aikZpmTqbavs44%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./peter-condopoulos-net-worth-income-salary-earnings-biography-how-much-money-make-html.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Peter Condopoulos Net Worth, Income, Salary, Earnings, Biography, How much money make?</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./jennifer-belle-saget.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Jennifer Saget Age, Parents, Father, Siblings, Dating &amp;amp; Net Worth</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
