Per the docs, Kim describes their marriage as “irretrievably broken” and lists their date of separation as December 23, 2021.</p><p>Kim, who has been living in Florida since the split, is asking for primary custody of her and ex’s three minor children — Amber, 15, Cassia, 13, and Mercy, 11. The pair also <a href=#>share kids</a> <strong>Ethan</strong>, 26, <strong>Hosanna</strong>, 24, <strong>Micah</strong>, 23, <strong>Moriah</strong>, 21, <strong>Lydia</strong>, 20, and <strong>Isaac</strong>, 18.</p><p>“Plaintiff shows that she is a fit and proper parent to care for the minor children and that she is entitled to both temporary and permanent primary custody of the minor children,” the docs state, noting that Kim is also asking that Barry, 56, pay child support.</p><p>The docs go on to state that Kim is “entitled to an equitable division” of “marital property” shared between her and Barry, and asks that “marital debts” shared by the two be “apportioned between the parties.”</p><p>Kim and Barry have starred on TLC’s <a href=#>Welcome to Plathville</a> since 2019. The reality series follows the family as their children begin to forge their own path and go against their conservative and strict upbringing.

We have been through many highs and lows in our 24 years of marriage and as we navigate this new chapter in our lives, we will coparent our amazing children.” (Kim has since moved on with her boyfriend, <strong>Ken Palmer</strong>.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The former spouses’ divorce filing comes eight months after Ethan and <strong>Olivia Plath</strong> <a href=#>announced their own breakup</a> after five years of marriage. “Ethan and I have decided to go our separate ways,” Olivia, 26, wrote <a href=# rel=noopener>via Instagram</a> in October 2023. “I have ambivalent memories of us being 18 years old, innocently dreaming of forever – but the partner you choose is a reflection of the world you want to live in, and at 18 I didn’t know who I was or what kind of life I wanted to create for myself.”</p><p>She went on to write: “There were good moments and I want to remember and honor those. We fell in love as children and are going our separate ways as adults. Wiser, older, and braver. We will be OK.”</p><p>In an <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram statement</a> of his own, Ethan added: “It just didn’t work between us, though Lord knows we both gave it all we had. It seemed we were constantly pulling each other in opposite directions in life with different goals.” In joint divorce docs filed in February, the two listed their date of separation as February 25, 2023.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGawnZyYvK6xjK2mZqiclsGpwsilo56rXaC2rnnPpZitoF2btq2x0madqKpdmba3u9GcnGaeoqS6bq7Aq6myZaChrrW0jg%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./weyauwega-car-accident.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Weyauwega Car Accident: Emmaus Lutheran Church pastor loses 4 children to mistaken DUI, US Highway 1</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./venue-news-hagars-cabo-wabo-cantina-to-open-in-lake-tahoe.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>VENUE NEWS: Hagar's Cabo Wabo Cantina To Open In Lake Tahoe</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
