During the set, which was part of the casino’s Aces of Comedy series, the comedian also revealed some of her jokes that she contends were cut from the hosting gig.</p><p>“I don’t even know what to say about the Oscars. Like, I really don’t know what to say. I have no jokes about it,” Schumer told the crowd, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Vanity Fair</a>. All I can say is that I don’t know if you saw this, but Will Smith slapped Chris Rock. Did you read that in your newsfeed?”</p><p>She continued, referring to Smith as “Ali,” from his 2001 film of the same name about the life of the boxer Muhammad Ali.</p><p>“I was kind of feeling myself…and then all of a sudden, Ali was making his way up,” recalled Schumer. “And it was just a fucking bummer. All I can say is that it was really sad, and I think it says so much about toxic masculinity. It was really upsetting, but I think the best way to comfort ourselves would be for me to say the Oscar jokes that I wasn’t allowed to say on TV.”</p><p>One joke in particular, however, about the shooting on the set of Rust, sounds like it was best left on the cutting room floor.</p><p>“Don’t Look Up is the name of a movie? More like don’t look down the barrel of Alec Baldwin’s shotgun,” she said. “I wasn’t allowed to say any of that [at the Oscars], but you can just come up and [slap] someone.”</p><p>Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed during filming when Alec Baldwin fired a prop gun that discharged a live round, with subsequent investigations into the incident indicating the weapon had not been thoroughly checked for safety before filming the scene. The family of Hutchins has since <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">sued Baldwin</a> over the shooting, but the actor <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">continues to maintain his innocence</a>.</p><p>Some of Schumer’s other cut jokes apparently involved Joe Rogan and the James Franco sexual misconduct allegations.</p><p>On social media following the Oscars, Schumer said that she was “triggered and traumatized” by Smith slapping Rock.</p><p>“I think we can all agree that the best way to unpack what happened is to stream my series Life & Beth and see me on tour this fall,” Schumer wrote in a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">since-deleted Instagram post</a>. “But for real. Still triggered and traumatized. I love my friend Chris Rock and believe he handled it like a pro. Stayed up there and gave an Oscar to his friend Questlove and the whole thing was so disturbing. So much pain in Will Smith anyway … I’m still in shock and stunned and sad. I’m proud of myself and my cohosts. But yeah. Waiting for this sickening feeling to go away from what we all witnessed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8CmsGark53CrrHRZpilnZNir6K4w7Cgp2WiqsC1ecmoop5lk6rBbrvSnJirq18%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ashley-grahams-pregnancy-pics-baby-bump-album.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ashley Grahams Pregnancy Pics: Baby Bump Album</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./s-s-rajamouli-rrr-movie-critics-choice-awards-m-m-keeravani-naatu-naatu-song-html.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>'RRR' wins Critics Choice Award for best foreign language film.
