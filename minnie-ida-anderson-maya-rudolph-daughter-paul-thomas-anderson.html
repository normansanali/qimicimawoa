Besides Minnie, Maya has three other children, named <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal>Pearl Minnie Anderson</a><strong>,</strong> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal><strong>Lucille Anderson</strong>, and <strong>Jack Anderson</strong></a>.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Talking about Minnie’s parents, her mother is an actress as well as a comedian whereas her father <strong>Paul Thomas Anderson</strong> is a director and a producer. Let’s get to know more about Ida and her family.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Ida_Was_Born_In_House></span>Ida Was Born In House<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Maya Rudolph’s daughter Minnie Ida Anderson was born in her home. According to the gossip sites, Maya gave birth to her youngest daughter in her home in order to avoid the media’s attention. Also, she wanted no records regarding her daughter’s birth.</p><p>Maya reportedly filed for her daughter Minnie’s birth certificate literally one year after her birth. She didn’t want to catch people’s attention and did not want to become the headline of gossip. Well, we can say for sure her plan worked out as we came to know about her kid a year after she was born.</p><p>In addition, Ida was named after her grandmother <strong>Minnie Riperton</strong>. Her grandmother was a singer; in fact, she was a top singer of her time. Well looks like she is en route to making her family proud. The child who has not even turned 10 yet appeared on her father’s movie&nbsp;<a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">Licorice Pizza</a>&nbsp;as an under one roofed kid. Let’s hope to see her more on the screen in the future.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Lives_In_A_Family_Of_Six></span>Lives In A Family Of Six<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Little girl Minnie Ida lives with her parents and three elder siblings,<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link=internal> Jackson Wright Anderson, Lucille Anderson</a>, and Pearl Minnie Anderson. Despite the number of family members, she is mostly seen with her mom. Once, she was spotted with her mother Maya meandering through a farmer’s market in Los Angeles. The mother-daughter duo looked fabulous together and we can clearly see a parent’s love toward her kid.</p><p>Nonetheless, we can assume that her relationship with her fellow siblings is also great. Besides, Maya has not uploaded pictures of her children, maybe she is just being cautious regarding her kids. Minnie Ida’s parents live a low-key life so, there is not much information revealed about their children. However, from what we have heard, we can just imagine how much of a lovely bond Maya’s kids share.</p><p>Moreover, Ida is the youngest member of their family so, we can say for sure she is beloved by all. She is just like a little doll how will not anyone fall in love with her instantly.</p><p></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Busy_Mother_Maya></span>A Busy Mother Maya<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Minnie Ida Anderson’s mother, Maya Rudolph, is a well-known face when it comes to acting.
