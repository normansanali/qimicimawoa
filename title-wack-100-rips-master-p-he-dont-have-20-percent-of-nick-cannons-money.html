The longtime music manager was back at it on Monday (January 17) when he joined a Clubhouse conversation and decided to slander <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Master P’s</a> name.</p><p>In a clip of the conversation, Wack 100 calls the No Limit mogul “broke” and reminds his audience Master P lost his masters nearly two decades ago, which allegedly led to financial ruin. He also praises Nick Cannon for all of his success and claims Master P “don’t have 20 percent of Nick Cannon’s money.”</p><p>As he says in the audio, “First of all, he don’t own his masters, they took them eighteen years ago. You think this n-gga be selling noodles? The feds took his catalog, bro. Nick Cannon got real money, for real. Real, real money. I’m like, ‘How is [Master P] talking to this n-gga about what he doing and you ain’t nowhere in place, my n-gga. You can’t even stand with this man on a bad day. Who is you, bro, to be telling this n-gga about his business decisions and your business decisions ain’t been right for damn near 20 years!?”</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>He also argues, “P ain’t never been Baby. P has never in his life had the kind of money Baby had” when someone attempts to compare him to Bryan “Birdman” Williams.</p><p></p><p>Even if <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>Master P</a> was in dire straits (which Forbes will detest), he built the <a class=underline-link href=# rel=noopener>No Limit empire with just $10,000.</a> With the business acumen he’s gathered over the years, the 54-year-old has built a portfolio that most rappers would embrace. From Rap Snacks to Uncle P’s to Master Crunch Cereal, he’s erected several lucrative brands that have only expanded his net worth.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>Speaking to HipHopDX last month, Master P explained, “So I started No Limit with $10,000, and it turned into a multi-million dollar empire; went from selling no records to selling over a 100 million records. It’s a blessing. You gotta dream big. Yeah. You got to, yeah. You just gotta dream big.”</p><a class=related-article--container href=#><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static.hiphopdx.com/2021/12/Master-P.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=related-article--tagline>related<span> news</span></p><h3 class=related-article--title>Master P Started His No Limit Empire With Just $10K: 'You Don't Have To Have A Lot Of Money'</h3><p class=related-article--meta-information>December 13, 2021</p></a><p>In 2021, Forbes&nbsp;listed Master P’s net worth at around $200 million after he signed&nbsp;an unprecedented distribution deal, released numerous multi-platinum albums, sold over 100 million records worldwide and expanded into the grocery business. He has a theory as to why he’s continued to find success.</p><p>AD LOADING...</p><p>“If you do the right thing, the Lord will keep blessing and that’s what people got to realize,” he told DX. “I mean, I’ve been successful at this for 25 years, and God has been blessing me because I’ve been blessing other people.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmigmaW1sLzDsWWcp51ku6bD0mignWZmbIB0f46toK2klWPEoq%2FKZmhpaF2ntrG%2FjKaYrKyVp3qxeceeZJ2nnql6qa3VnmRraF2lsrOvxKerZqeWYruqr8pmmpqmnqS7tHnMqKWesQ%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./alexandra-brittany-datt-height-weight-net-worth-age-birthday-wikipedia-who-instagram-biography.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Alexandra Brittany Datt Height, Weight, Net Worth, Age, Birthday, Wikipedia, Who, Instagram, Biograp</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./67126-top-5-doa-your-favorite-rappers-share-their-favorite-rapper-news.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Top 5 DOA: Your Favorite Rappers Share Their Favorite Rapper</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
