were on a chartered yacht on the Miami River, when two men allegedly became “very aggressive” toward the captain and his crew.</p><p>The captain told them that their rental time was running out and that they had to return to the dock, but the men demanded a refund and started making verbal threats.</p><p>One of the men allegedly threatened to kill the captain and throw him off the boat, and also took his wallet and phone from his pocket.</p><p>The owner of the boat called 911 and reported a possible armed robbery.</p><p>The police arrived at the scene and detained several people, including Quavo, who was seen in a video with his hands zip-tied behind his back.</p><h2><span id=What_did_the_police_find>What did the police find?</span></h2><p>The police searched the yacht and found two firearms, but they said that the guns were not used in any alleged threats.</p><p>They also interviewed the people on board, but they gave conflicting statements about what happened.</p><p>Some said that the captain’s wallet and phone were taken, while others said that they were not.</p><p>The police did not make any arrests at the time, due to the lack of evidence and cooperation.</p><p>They released everyone and let them go without incident.</p><p>They said that they would continue to investigate the case and review the surveillance footage from the yacht.</p><h2><span id=What_did_Quavo_say>What did Quavo say?</span></h2><p>Quavo has not commented publicly on the incident, but his attorney, Drew Findling, told TMZ that his client was not involved in any wrongdoing.</p><p>He said that Quavo was not mentioned in the police report narrative and that he was not even listed as a witness to any alleged dispute.</p><p>He also said that Quavo was not arrested or charged with anything.</p><p>Quavo is one of the most successful and influential rappers in the music industry today.</p><p><a href=#>He is part of the rap group Migos, Offset, and Takeoff.</a></p><p>He has also released solo projects and collaborated with artists like Drake, Justin Bieber, Travis Scott, and DJ Khaled.</p><p>Quavo is also dating rapper Saweetie, who recently
