If your old <b>VHS tapes</b> need <b>cleaning</b>, it’s best to use a mechanical <b>tape cleaner</b>. In the event you cannot find a <b>tape cleaner</b>, you can gradually remove film from a <b>tape</b> to <b>clean</b> it manually. However, a <b>tape cleaner</b> is usually the safer option.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-fix-fuzzy-vhs-tapes></span>How do you fix fuzzy VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Spray a few shots of compressed air inside the <b>VCR</b>. This can remove any dust and debris sticking to the inside of the <b>tape</b> deck. Insert the <b>VHS</b> cleaner into the <b>VCR</b> and press “Play.” Allow it to run for a few minutes. The <b>tape</b> in the <b>VHS</b> cleaner cleans the heads of the <b>VCR</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-damaged-vhs-tapes-be-restored></span>Can damaged VHS tapes be restored?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>VHS TAPE RESTORATION</b> SERVICES<p>Some <b>VHS</b> cassette <b>tapes</b> were recorded over 30 years ago, and we understand the vulnerability and value of these recordings. Many of the issues that may come about over time are repairable, and the audio and video content is usually recoverable.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-can-i-improve-old-vhs-tapes></span>How can I improve old VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>One of the best investments to help with <b>video tape</b> restoration are: A good, reliable <b>VCR</b>, a color correction unit, and a time-based corrector. At DVD Your Memories, we’ve often found that many VCRs from the 90s will play beat-up <b>VHS tapes</b> better than a brand new one from the store.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=does-costco-repair-vhs-tapes></span>Does Costco repair VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>We certainly <b>do</b>! We’ve partnered with YesVideo to convert your old videotapes, film reels, slides and photographs into DVD or digital formats.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-i-still-buy-a-vcr></span>Can I still buy a VCR?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>You <b>can still buy a VCR</b> player, just not from your usual electronics store. New <b>VCRs</b> haven’t been produced by any manufacturers since 2016, but there are plenty of places to <b>still purchase</b> a new (unopened), used or refurbished <b>VCRs</b>. We have found 9 great websites for <b>buying</b> used <b>VCRs</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=will-vcrs-ever-be-made-again></span>Will VCRs ever be made again?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>For VHS to really <b>make</b> a come <b>back</b>, shops <b>would</b> have to get on board with the idea if they were <b>ever</b> to <b>make</b> it <b>back</b> into the mainstream. However, this is very unlikely. The last film released on VHS was <b>back</b> in 2006, so more than ten years later it’s not very likely they <b>will</b> be put <b>back</b> into production.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-you-buy-a-vcr-player></span>Can you buy a VCR player?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>You can buy</b> used and fairly new <b>VHS players</b> from most of the major websites <b>you</b> probably think of first, like Amazon or Craiglist – even Facebook. When <b>you</b>‘re less price sensitive and truly looking to <b>buy</b> from a trusted professional, <b>we</b> recommend three sites, in no particular <b>order</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-can-i-do-with-2020-vhs-tapes></span>What can I do with 2020 VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes, <b>VHS tapes</b> are recyclable. You <b>can</b> recycle them with specialist <b>VHS tape</b> recycling services like GreenCitizen, though there will normally be a fee. You could also choose to send them to a waste-to-energy incineration recycling plant where they will be burned to produce green energy.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-i-keep-old-vhs-tapes></span>Should I keep old VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>VHS tapes should</b> be kept out of the sun in a cool, dry place where the temperature is consistent. Extreme cold and heat degrade <b>tapes</b> more quickly. Like CDs and DVDs, <b>tapes should</b> be stored vertically to cut down on the risk of warping or breaking. It’s also wise to rewind <b>VHS tapes</b> fully after watching them.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-can-you-do-with-old-vcr-players></span>What can you do with old VCR players?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Instead, look for local recycling companies. (For this and other tough recycling quandaries, try Green Citizen, 1800recycling.com or earth911.com.) Or search for vintage shops or record stores to see if they will accept <b>VHS</b> tapes.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=who-takes-old-vcr></span>Who takes old VCR?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Best Buy will <b>take</b> back <b>old VCRs</b> and many other home electronics for free; they also offer a trade-in program for more desired electronics.

The tape <b>can be</b> coated in harmful metals like Chromium, and shouldn’t end up in a landfill.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-are-the-most-valuable-vhs-tapes></span>What are the most valuable VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The cartoon version of Disney’s 101 Dalmatians is the one with the <b>most value</b> on eBay at the moment. There’s also the live-action one, but those <b>tapes</b> aren’t priced very high right now. As of November 2019, a used Black Diamond edition of the cartoon 101 Dalmatians is listed on eBay for $22,500.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-i-sell-vhs-tapes></span>How do I sell VHS tapes?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Here are some places you can try flogging those old <b>VHS</b> tapes:</b><li class=TrT0Xe>eBay. eBay is the king when it comes to <b>selling</b> unwanted items that you don’t think have a re-sale value.</li><li class=TrT0Xe>Amazon.

The 2 things to remember is that <b>VHS</b> is long-tail inventory, and, profit margin. The bulk of our inventory is estate <b>buys</b> and retail close-outs, our typical cost, less than 17 cents each (6 for $1) average <b>sale</b>, $6.95 each.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-charity-shops-take-vhs-videos></span>Do charity shops take VHS videos?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Do charity shops take VHS tapes</b>? <b>Charity shops</b> will accept donations of commercial <b>videos</b>.
