However, none of the Wall Street star’s many brushes with justice benefited his career quite like his 2017 arrest for public intoxication in Georgia.</p><p>During the court-ordered rehab stint that followed, LaBeouf conjured up one of the highest-rated films of his career: Honey Boy. In the film, LaBeouf portrays James Lort, a manic-aggressive drug addict unmistakably inspired by the notorious Jeffrey Craig LaBeouf.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/shia-labeouf-honey-boy.jpg><p>However, about three years after the film’s debut, LaBeouf admitted that he’d exaggerated some aspects of his relationship with his dad to fit his preferred narrative.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“I wrote this narrative, which was just f***ing nonsense,” he admitted on Jon Bernthal’s Real One’s podcast. “My dad was so loving to me my whole life. Fractured, sure. Crooked, sure. Wonky, for sure. But never was not loving, never was not there. He was always there.”</p><p>The acclaimed actor went on to admit that his dad was never nearly as abusive as he came off in the film. “I turned the knob up on certain s*** that wasn’t real,” he said. “My dad never hit me, never. He spanked me once, one time. And the story that gets painted in Honey Boy is this dude is abusing his kid all the time.”</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Shia LaBeouf Makes Creepy Comments About Falling In Love With Every Female Co-Star He Works With</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Despite their longstanding strained relationship, LaBeouf regretted painting such a grim and unseemly picture of his dad. "Here's a man who I've done vilified on a grand scale," he said. "I put all his s**t in the street and used him…as like, 'This is the reason why I'm f***ing foul out here.

Because I didn't put that s**t in there," he shared with Jon Bernthal’s Real One’s podcast. "I was bulls***ing him.
