But the quintessential Googie example was incorporated in a 1958 sign for Sin City’s own Stardust Casino and Hotel. A miasma of glittering, colorful light befitting stardust, the roadside marquee complemented a galaxy of planets that comprised the main signage on the casino building, along with another explosion of 20 neon starbursts.</p><p>The Stardust sign is said to have utilized 7,100 feet of neon tubing with more than 11,000 bulbs along its 216-foot front. The “S” alone contained 975 lamps and, at night, the neon constellation was reportedly visible 60 miles away. But with changing times comes changing aesthetics, and thus the sign eventually lost much of its Jetsonian features long before its 2007 demolition.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19159 alt="Las Vegas" width=750 height=513 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-Vegas.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19159 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Yahoo</a></p><p>Another Vegas sign still remains, though, and many consider it the most famous example of Googie fonts and shapes. Welcoming people to the Las Vegas strip for nearly 55 years, the iconic “Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas” roadside sign looks the same as it did when first designed in 1959.</p><p>In recent years, architects, historians, designers and scholars alike have expressed a newfound appreciation for the Googie style, and preservation efforts to save remaining structures are ongoing.Most evocative of this resurgent fascination was Clark County’s December 2008 decision to open a small parking lot in the median of Las Vegas Boulevard to allow official public access to the Las Vegas sign for the first time ever. While it cost over $400,000 to achieve, many left wondering why it hadn’t been done before.</p><p>Several other examples of Googie architecture have managed to survive amid the changing architectural dynamics in the 21st century United States. Flying into Los Angeles for instance, travelers may bear witness to another iconic example, the Theme Building at LAX.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19156 alt="Googie Architecture LAX" width=750 height=500 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-LAX.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19156 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wikipedia</a></p><p>Farther north in the Pacific Northwest, another Googie archetype towers over Seattle. The famous Space Needle was built for the 1962 Seattle World’s Fair.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19157 alt="Space Needle" width=750 height=562 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-Needle.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19157 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wiki Nut</a></p><p>While the Googie style was inherently American and grew along with the popularity of the automobile in the suburbs, its influence was not constrained to national borders. Though England’s roadsides featured architecture that was not quite as bold as Googie designs in America, the 1951 Festival of Britain included buildings that would definitely be classified as Googie.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19152 alt=Gtomium width=750 height=562 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-Atomium.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19152 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Shed Expedition</a></p><p>Another unmistakable example is the Atomium in Brussels, built for the 1958 World’s Fair. The preternaturally shiny monolith represents one of Googie’s most common motifs, a nucleus being orbited by electrons. Other Googie motifs included kidney shapes, undefined blobs, starbursts, circles and diamonds, like those seen in the main terminal at the Washington Dulles International Airport</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19155 alt=Harveys width=750 height=604 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-Harveys.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19155 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Blogspot</a></p><p>Though many Googie buildings have now been razed, many of the style’s less celebrated examples continue to dot the American landscape. Harvey’s Broiler, a diner designed by Paul Clayton and built in 1958, was partially demolished in 2006. Preservationists and loyal Broiler patrons alike pushed to have the drive-in restored, and soon enough the Downey, CA establishment reopened its doors in 2009 as a Bob’s Big Boy restaurant.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-19153 alt="Googie Architecture Dulles Airport" width=750 height=445 data-sizes="(max-width: 750px) 100vw, 750px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/Saving-Googie-Architecture-Dulles.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-19153 class=wp-caption-text>Source: <a href=#>Wikimedia</a></p><p>By the late 1960s, architects had shifted their focus away from the stars and thus designed far fewer examples of “Googie architecture”—a term coined in 1952 by House and Home editor Douglas Haskell—and its sensibilities were eventually ridiculed or disparaged among architectural circles. But the major buildings that remain as relics today continue to remind us of that era’s unquestionable optimism toward all that awaited in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufonyou86goJ5lkaewqbXTnpqtraKa</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./gwyneth-paltrow-topless-fleece-jacket-goop-6754389.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Gwyneth Paltrow Went Topless Under a Fleece Jacket in Honor of Fall</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./gemma-styles.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Gemma Styles Net Worth 2024, Age, Height, Bio, Birthday, Wiki!</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
