She has earned tens of millions of dollars from paid social endorsements and from the service OnlyFans.</p><p>Bregoli is reportedly one of the highest-earning celebrities on OnlyFans. During her first year on the platform, she earned an astonishing $50 million.</p><h2><span id=Early_Life_of_Danielle_Bregoli>Early Life of Danielle Bregoli</span></h2><p>Danielle Peskowitz Bregoli was born on March 23, 2003, in Boynton Beach, Florida.

She quickly gained a social media following and appeared in the music video “Everything 1K’ by Kodak Black. Bregoli released her debut single “These Heaux” in 2017 and became the youngest female rapper ever to appear on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.

The deal pays Danielle $350,000 upfront and then will pay two additional $350,000 installments after reaching set revenue milestones. She will also earn 70% of future record sales profits.</p><p>In addition to product placements, Bregoli is also reportedly charging up to $40,000 for meet and greet sessions.

She went on to claim in August 2021 that her OnlyFans income alone made her rich enough to pay $4 million cash for a mansion and retire forever.</p><p>However, many were skeptical when she announced in April 2022 that she had already made $50 million from OnlyFans after being on the platform for just one year. Bregoli then posted an earnings statement screenshot to her Instagram account, which appears to be real, showing that she had grossed nearly $53 million from OnlyFans between April 1, 2021 and April 25, 2022. After the platform’s cut, she netted $42 million in pre-tax net income.</p><p>According to the earnings statement, Bregoli earned $16 million from subscriptions, $25 million from messages, and $160,000 from tips.

The home was previously owned by NFL player Jason Pierre-Paul, who bought the property in 2017 for $2.3 million. While Bregoli’s mother Barbara Bregoli is listed as the named trustee on the acquiring trust, it is believed that Danielle is the true owner of the property.</p><p>This purchase comes just months after Bregoli revealed her plans to potentially buy a $4 million mansion in Boca Raton. However, she ended up paying $6 million for the property.</p><p>Bregoli also owns a home in Calabassas, California.</p><h2>You May Also Like</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiopaG9ta3SraCcZpOkunCwwKegnqScmnqjvsSgpqWhXaOytXnWqKmtoF8%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./ellen-degeneres-portia-de-rossi-amazon-alexa-super-bowl-commercial-2020-ad-watch.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Ellen DeGeneres &amp;amp; Portia de Rossi Star In Amazons Alexa Super Bowl Ad Hollywood Life</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./clare-sarah-branson.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Clare Sarah Branson - Bio, Age, Nationality, Height, Career, Facts</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
