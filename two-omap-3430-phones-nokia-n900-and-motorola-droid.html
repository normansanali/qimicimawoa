It's an interesting perspective that this gives us, as they're no longer the latest and greatest, but still far above average, and a ways from being obsolete.</p><a class=thickbox href=# title><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3764/3430-9210_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>From a physical perspective, the Motorola Droid remains the flagship of Android phones that come with a hardware keyboard - a feature that enthusiasts and casual users alike still identify as hugely important. If having a hardware keyboard is important to you, the Motorola Droid is almost the only option out there with a modern ARMv7 CPU.</p><a class=thickbox href=# title><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3764/3430-9187_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Even though Motorola's summer refresh is looming - likely bringing along the Motorola Droid 2 and Motorola Droid Xtreme - the phone that launched Android 2.0 will still get an update to Android 2.2 'Froyo,' and likely be offered at a discount price as it continues its life cycle. Already, Verizon is offering buy one get one free on the device. In fact, although many expected Motorola Droid sales to slow down significantly after the HTC Incredible's launch, sales continue to shore up supply, with Motorola's Sanjay Jha making note of device shortages similar to the HTC Incredible's due to demand.</p><a class=thickbox href=# title><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3764/3430-9372_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>Motorola's made support for its current Droid an obvious priority, as we've seen the device get multitouch in the browser, maps, and gallery, with Android 2.1 among other important features. From a performance perspective, the Motorola Droid's 550 MHz Cortex A8 simply isn't a match for the 1 GHz A8 in Snapdragon's Scorpion CPU - but the Motorola Droid's GPU is faster. The OMAP 3430 still has a lot of life in it waiting for overclockers - in fact, many already do. From a battery life perspective, call time on the Motorola Droid is absurdly long compared to other smartphones at 8.13 hours. In spite of the looming Droid 2 and Xtreme, the original Droid is a sound choice to make if you're on Verizon and absolutely need a hardware keyboard. Though we didn't test it - I would expect much of the same from the handset's GSM cousin - the Motorola Milestone.</p><a class=thickbox href=# title><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3764/3430-9392_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>&nbsp;</p><p>On the other side of the room, the N900 is a true superphone. It's had features since launch that are only this month starting to launch on Android and iOS - full video calling with a front facing camera (on Skype, Google Talk, and SIP), and full Flash support being the obvious two. However, Nokia's lack of front and center advertising, coupled with 3G compatibility with only T-Mobile in the United States, means it really hasn't taken off like it could have and remains largely misunderstood. That said, if you're a *nix nerd, this is still the phone for you. The N900's one major caveat is that PR 1.2 looks like the last of Nokia's official firmware updates for the platform, as it will not run MeeGo - at least officially. For that, you'll have to wait for the rumored N9.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Update:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A number of commenters have pointed out that the N900 will indeed run MeeGo, however it will recieve unofficial support that doesn't include Nokia Care. MeeGo will be an option for those who want to make the jump, and obviously even without official support there's a teeming enthusiast community that'll keep the N900 updated on into the future.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><a class=thickbox href=# title><img alt src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.anandtech.com/doci/3764/3430-8977_575px.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a><p>When I sat down to tackle the N900, I was hugely excited because of how much potential Maemo still has as it evolves into MeeGo. A month later, I still feel the same way - like I've explored maybe 10% of the platform's real depth. There's something to be said for how truly and completely open Nokia's approach is compared to platforms like Android and iOS. For as big on 'open' as these latter two platforms advertise being, it's refreshingly mindblowing to see Nokia offering instructions on how to get superuser access on their own handset, on their own support website. Contrast that to iOS or Android where one has jailbreak or 'root', respectively, to do things the platform creators don't intend. To that end, I find it incredibly depressing when the Linux chief architect himself, Linus Torvalds, (who is notably Finnish, same as Nokia) embraces Android over Maemo. It's the difference between a platform that lets you fire up a preinstalled X-Term and apt-get install away versus one that doesn't. While that's not really an end-user feature that any handset maker will tout, it's telling about platform philosophy.<br>&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7orrAp5utnZOde6S7zGiqoaenZIB4gpNoq7CnXaS6oryMbGtsaF2ltbC6xKxkp6ebnq5uuphpZ2aZnpl6rrvTqKmopJFisbO7yJ1ma2o%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./kiwi-nikko.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Kiwi Nikko- Age, Net Worth, Height, Boyfriend, Career, Ethnicity</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./eric-andre-opens-up-about-being-bisexual-what-is-the-reality.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Eric Andr Opens Up About Being Bisexual?
