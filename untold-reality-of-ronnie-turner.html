Tina attempted singing with Ike Turner one night in 1957 after first seeing him perform with the Kings of Rhythm band in a bar. Ike was so taken aback by Tina’s vocals that they started working together and released their debut song in 1958.</p><p>Following the success of their single “A Fool in Love,” which was published in July 1960, Tina and Ike embarked on a cross-country tour, building their fame and wealth and getting engaged in 1962.

The same year, she also released the album “Private Dancer,” which peaked at number three on the Billboard 200 and has remained her most popular album to this day.</p><p>She began her acting career in 1985 when she costarred with Mel Gibson in the film “Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.” She later made appearances in a number of other films, such as “Last Action Hero” and “Tina Turner: Girl From Nutbush” in 1993. “Twenty-Four Seven,” her most recent album, was released in 1999.
