As Hernandez explains, she was constantly being given raises for her work. However, there was good reason for this. Overall, she was the cast's most popular personality, and the network wanted to keep her on board for many years. “Within the first week I went from making like $1,500 per episode to making $11,000 per episode," she revealed. "In a week. I didn’t ask for them to bump me up, they bumped me up.”</p><p><strong>Read More: <a href=# rel>Joseline Hernandez Tells Haters To Back Off After Blasting Bobby Lytes’ Outfit</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joseline-hernandez-tells-all>Joseline Hernandez Tells All</h2></span><p>She then continued about her salary trajectory and how it eventually reached $50K per episode. “Then second season, I was making like $15,000, and then like by the end of second season I went up to like $20,000…they just kept bumping me up," Hernandez says. "They was just throwing money at me they was like ‘we don’t want her not to come to work’…they would just bump me up. They did that for years.” Considering the amount of episodes in a season, Hernandez could make close to $2 million per year. Moreover, she was getting a bonus that was close to $250K, every single season. Needless to say, she was bringing home a lot of cash.</p><p>If you are looking for an industry to get into, perhaps reality TV is the way to go.
