Her mental health is in question once again, but this time, fans are rushing to social media in an effort to see if she may need saving. Some of her most recent posts are causing quite a stir, as fans see<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> a cry for help amid her cryptic messaging</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Many&nbsp;fans believe they see the words "Call 911" written within her eyelashes in a social media post which clearly depicts a lot of intentional focus being put on the area of her eyes.</p><p>The eerie coincidences in this post are worrisome, and fans are vocal about their concern. She is reportedly still dealing with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">issues surrounding her conservatorship</a>, which may be playing a part in this...</p><p>Could this be a cry for help? Is there something wrong with Britney Spears that she is trying to convey with cryptic messaging?</p><h2 id=the-eerie-cry-for-help>The Eerie Cry For Help</h2><p>There's no questioning the fact that this image is a bit haunting. The positioning of her body and the way Britney Spears is looking up at the camera with that devilish look in her eyes is not easy to ignore.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you got a strange feeling when you first viewed this image, or it gave you a bit of a weird vibe, you were not alone. Many felt the same way, and the caption gave fans even more reason to worry. For those not already staring at her eyes in this image, Britney seemed to intentionally draw more focus to her eyes with her caption, which stated; "the natural light always reveals the magic in the eyes ‚òÄÔ∏èüëÄüíã !!!!!!

The fans do. Many claim to see the word "call" appear under one eye and the numerics "911" appear in the lashes of the other. Some fans are speculating whether she is being held against her will. Others question if Britney is alive as her recent images show her in the same outfits and the paparazzi hasn't captured her in any candid photos for a very long time.</p><p>One fan wrote: "What if she's already dead? She didn't post any photo of her kids f√≥r two years and All the videos and photos looks like arch√≠ved photos, still the same shorts and top I'm really confused. Also her family act like she doesn't exist and it scares me a lot."</p><p>Another concerned fan worried about potential mental health issues&nbsp;&nbsp;wants to escalate this matter and get her some help rather than just talk about what could be wrong. She wrote: "Is there a way we can demand a wellness check for her? Look at how many people are genuinely concerned for her safety!!
