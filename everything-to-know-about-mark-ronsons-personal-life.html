Ronson, 47, who is the executive producer of the hotly anticipated movie, starring <strong>Ryan Gosling</strong>, and <strong>Margot Robbie</strong>, is also the man behind the beloved track,<i> I'm Just Ken.&nbsp;</i></p><p>Mark Daniel Ronson was born on September 4, 1975, in Notting Hill, London, to<strong> Laurence Ronson,</strong> a former music manager, and <strong>Ann Dexter-Jones</strong>, a writer. With an affluent and well-known background as his safety net, Ronson kicked off his career as a DJ in the early 90s. Ten years down the line, the Brit had released successful albums and scored for films. &nbsp;</p><h3>Who is Mark Ronson Married to? &nbsp;</h3><p>Ronson is a happily married man. Alongside his acclaimed multi-faceted career, the Grammy-winning music producer is also navigating a high-profile relationship. He married actress <strong>Grace Gummer, </strong>the daughter of the legendary actress <strong>Meryl Streep</strong>, in 2021. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/12/356596900_569151728748675_2436479387109898637_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689176367609.jpg><p>Ronson and Gummer first sparked dating rumors in late 2020. Siding with the ideology of keeping it low-key until it's official, Ronson, and Gummer rarely encouraged the swirling heat about their new romance. The A-list couple then sparked engagement rumors in May and that was when Mark decided to give in.&nbsp;</p><p>"I got engaged last weekend," said the seven-time Grammy winner during his <i>The Fader Uncovered</i> podcast. A source close to the producer revealed how Mark won over the <i>Devil Wears Prada</i> actress, and her husband, <strong>Don Gummer.</strong> &nbsp;</p><p>"They seemed to like him, which is a good sign," the source said. The couple walked down the aisle in September 2021 in an intimate ceremony. The news broke out only after the English producer took to Instagram to announce his married status on his 45th birthday. &nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/12/270915325_330127885435359_658521679351634644_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689176375470.jpg><p>&nbsp;Posting a black and white snippet of their nuptial, Ronson penned a long, heartfelt caption, in which he pledged to love his new wife forever. "To my truest love...out of nowhere, you made 45 hands down the greatest year of my life," Ronson wrote in his sweet caption. &nbsp;</p><p>He added, "And I'm sure it took me 45 years to become the man worthy of your love."Giving insight into the duo's hush-hush wedding, an insider revealed how the couple cut down the huge guest list and kept things private due to the pandemic. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>The couple walked down the aisle in an intimate ceremony in September 2021.</strong></p><figure class=media></figure><p>Mark surely isn't the most forthcoming lover but falling in love with Gummer has certainly awakened his latent romantic nature. While celebrating their first wedding ceremony, Mark gushed about his wife and shared how he is now cheesily romantic. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/12/244623564_388863396120724_2977578291474953110_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689176385145.jpg><p>In the gushy post, Ronson described his new self as "someone who spouts hallmark nonsense or is a freak anomaly of love." The music producer and his wife of nearly two years recently became first-time parents, as they <a href=#>welcomed </a>a girl. &nbsp;</p><p>The couple's ongoing blissful marriage marks the second for both of them. Gummer, 37, is a member of an acclaimed acting dynasty, which includes her mother, sister <strong>Mamie Gummer, </strong>and more. Grace's best-known credits are <i>Zero Hour, Extant</i>, and <i>Mr. Robot. </i>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3>The Truth About Mark Ronson's Dating History! &nbsp;&nbsp;</h3><p>There isn't a sliver of doubt that Ronson has met the one. But before the London-born songwriter could stumble upon his soulmate, he experienced a few heartbreaks. The DJ-turned-producer dated actress/singer <strong>Rashida Jones</strong> in the early 2000s. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/12/294170305_187546106952850_2003239032082359015_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689176394934.jpg><p>The duo's young love even transpired into something serious when Ronson proposed to Rashida on her 27th birthday. The betrothal never transpired into a marriage as the couple called it quits after a year. Ronson's dating profile was dry for several years until he met French actress/model <strong>Joséphine de La Baume. &nbsp;</strong></p><p>Mark and Joséphine first met in 2009 and a year later, Baume even starred in Ronson's MV, <i>The Bike Song.</i> The twosome got engaged in early 2011 and tied the knot in September 2011. The producer and his French wife called it quits after six years together and Joséphine filed for divorce in May 2017. &nbsp;</p><p>The estranged pair's divorce was finalized in October 2018, following which the Grammy winner producer got candid on his failed relationships. The <i>Uptown Funk</i> producer stated that being a workaholic strained his relationships with his former partners. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedceleb.com/uploads/biography/2023/7/12/296001765_120588184046006_5766298976760899466_n%20(1)%20(1)-1689176406738.jpg><p>"Those workaholic tendencies became my best friend and my worst enemy at the same time," Mark explained.<a href=#> He added,</a> "At some point, if you do want to have a little bit of stability and balance in your life, you have to learn to let go." As for Mark's wife, Gummer, she was married to musician<strong> Tay Strathairn</strong> for 42 days.&nbsp;</p><p>Stay connected to <a href=#>Married Celeb</a> for more.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmilkae%2FqrHDnJylnZJjsLC5jp6tnqqpqbWqusZmq6hlm6O8uHnAm6aurF2irrO3jKump6ufo8BuvMSrqqimkaF6rbXFng%3D%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./how-tall-is-anthony-lexa-age-partner-career-wikipedia.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>How Tall Is Anthony Lexa?
