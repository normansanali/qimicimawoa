Born on March 8, 1959, in Marin County, California, Holt’s lineage includes Jamaican ancestry from his mother, and Indian and Scottish heritage from his father.</p><p>As the permanent anchor of NBC’s “Nightly News”, Lester’s estimated net worth in 2015 was around $16 million. His career as an anchor and reporter at NBC has not only brought him immense recognition but has also significantly contributed to his current net worth. Furthermore, Lester takes home an annual salary of $4 million, solidifying his status as a prominent figure in the industry.</p><p>His journey into media started during his time at Cordova High School in California, where he began to explore his passion for reporting, initially by narrating announcements and working at a local radio station. After attending California State University in Sacramento, where he pursued government studies without graduating, he ventured into the field by working as a disc jockey at a country and western radio station. Later, he embarked on his professional career, starting with CBS in New York as a reporter, before transitioning to KNXT in Los Angeles, and eventually returning to New York to work at WCBN TV.</p><p>Joining WBBM in Chicago in 1986 marked a significant chapter in Holt’s career, as he remained a news reporter there for 14 years, covering various tumultuous events in places like Haiti, Iraq, and El Salvador. His affiliation with NBC began in 2000, and in 2005, he became the cover for NBC Nightly News, ultimately securing the position of NBC Nightly News anchor since 2007. This role not only made Holt a household name but also emphasized his influence in American media. Beyond news anchoring, he has hosted several shows including “9-11 Conspiracy Theories” and covered the Beijing Summer Olympics in 2008.</p><p>Aside from his journalistic endeavors, Holt has also delved into television shows, featuring as a narrator on “Crystal Skulls” and making notable appearances in sitcoms and various films such as “Primal Fear”, “Red White and Blue”, “The Fugitive”, and “Fate”. These diverse projects have significantly contributed to his current net worth.</p><p>On a personal note, Holt tied the knot with Carol Hagen in 1982, and the couple shares two sons, one of whom, Stefan Holt, follows in his father’s footsteps as a morning news anchor at WMAQ-TV NBC5 Chicago. Holt is known to be a devout individual who regularly attends the Manhattan Church, and he also possesses musical talent, enjoying playing the bass guitar during his leisure time. Lester Holt currently resides in Manhattan, gracefully balancing his esteemed career with his substantial salary and widespread popularity, undoubtedly savoring the lifestyle his wealth affords him.</p><ul class=tabs-menu><li>Structural Info</li><li>Facts</li><li>Filmography</li><li>Awards</li></ul><table><tbody><tr><td>Full Name</td><td>Lester Holt</td></tr><tr><td>Net Worth</td><td>$16 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Salary</td><td>$4.5 Million</td></tr><tr><td>Date Of Birth</td><td>March 8, 1959</td></tr><tr><td>Place Of Birth</td><td>Marin County, California</td></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>1.87 m</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Journalist, anchor for Dateline NBC, reporter at NBC Nightly</td></tr><tr><td>Education</td><td>Cordova High School, California State University</td></tr><tr><td>Nationality</td><td>American</td></tr><tr><td>Spouse</td><td>Carol Hagen (1982-)</td></tr><tr><td>Children</td><td>Stefan Holt, Cameron Holt</td></tr><tr><td>Parents</td><td>June Holt, Lester Holt Sr.</td></tr><tr><td>Facebook</td><td>https://www.facebook.com/LesterHoltNBC</td></tr><tr><td>Twitter</td><td><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>https://twitter.com/lesterholtnbc</a></td></tr><tr><td>Instagram</td><td>https://www.instagram.com/lesterholtnbc/?hl=en</td></tr><tr><td>IMDB</td><td>www.imdb.com/name/nm0392473</td></tr><tr><td>Awards</td><td>Robert F.
