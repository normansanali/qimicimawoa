The market's evolution has seen a surge in the demand for rare and iconic cards, driving their market values to unprecedented levels.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Recent Blue-Eyes White Dragon Card Sales</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>In 2021, a PSA 10 Gem Mint condition copy of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon card #LOB-001 was sold for $85,000. Additionally, a promotional Prismatic Secret Rare Blue-Eyes White Dragon card from the 2002 Yu-Gi-Oh! Dark Duel Stories release was auctioned for $8,250. These sales underscore the enduring allure and substantial market value of the Blue-Eyes White Dragon card in 2021.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Variants and Their Impact on Market Value</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Blue-Eyes White Dragon card has been released in various editions and variants, each contributing to its overall market value.
