Dolly Parton grew up in a one-room cabin in Little Pigeon River in Tennessee with her two parents and 12 brothers and sisters! Parton's father worked a number of construction jobs and also worked as a sharecropper in order to make up for the family's little income. With that many kids under the same roof, it is no surprise that the family struggled at times.</p><h2 id=she-is-country-music-royalty><span class=item-num>10 </span><span>She Is Country Music Royalty</span></h2><h2><span class=item-num>9 </span><span></span></h2><p>Despite her rough upbringing, Dolly Parton has since become one of the biggest country music stars in the world.

In addition to her 25 chart-topping songs, Parton has also had 44 career top 10 country albums, which is a record that only she holds. If that doesn't scream record-breaking, then perhaps the fact that she has 110 career-charted singles over the past 40 years ought to do the job!</p><h2 id=all-of-which-she-has-written-herself><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>All Of Which She Has Written Herself</span></h2><p>While her record-breaking songs have without a doubt shaped the world of country music for the better, Dolly Parton has not only achieved such feats, but she is also the lead writer for all of her chart-topping songs.

The singer has written for Tina Turner, Sinead O'Connor and Hank Williams Jr, which has allowed Dolly Parton to make a lot of money, however, her biggest songwriting feat was for Whitney Houston.
