Given that he has over 11 million Instagram followers, it appears that he has a massive female fan base.</p><p class=Fg>Regardless of how many female fans swoon over his charm and exceptional talent, DC Young Fly only has one woman in his life for whom he continues to swoon: Jacky Oh.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/19a688e8414f825ffb20543164594a67.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>DC Young Fly and Jacky Oh at the State Farm Arena attending the game between the Denver Nuggets and the Atlanta Hawks on December 17, 2021, in Atlanta, Georgia. | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>Jacky Oh Is Not Just DC Young Fly's Partner</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Jacky has established herself as a model, businesswoman, actress, artist, producer, and content creator.

She has used the name ever since.</p><p class=Fg>Some of Jacky's fans have also thought she is a white woman because of her unique features, but she clarified that <a class="Xd a" href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" aria-label="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CDXg2mMVqQk">she is biracial</a> because she was born to a white mother and an African-American father.</p><p><h2 class=Jg><strong class=Dg>She Grew up with a Single Father</strong></h2></p><p class=Fg>Despite her mixed ethnicity, Jacky said she was raised entirely by her single father and was surrounded by her aunts, uncles, and cousins who are of African American descent.
