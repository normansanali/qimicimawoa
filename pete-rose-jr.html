When his father joined the Phillies in 1979, Rose Jr. spent time with Aaron Boone, Bret Boone, Ryan Luzinski, and Mark McGraw in the Phillies clubhouse. He appeared on a 1982 Fleer baseball card (#640) titled “Pete & Re-Pete; Pete Rose & son” with his father; he was twelve at the time. As a teenager, on September 11, 1985, he made an emotional on-field appearance live on ESPN to celebrate with his father after Rose Sr. broke Ty Cobb’s record for most career hits.</p><p>Rose’s best minor league season was in 1997 at Chattanooga, for the Chattanooga Lookouts, at age 27. He hit .308 in 112 games with 25 home runs, 98 RBIs, 31 doubles and 75 runs scored for the Lookouts. Later that year, Rose was called up to the Cincinnati Reds for his first and only time in the major leagues. He hit only .143 in just 11 games for the Reds, but was widely shown on popular sports highlight shows when he copied his dad’s famous crouching batting stance during the first pitch of his first Major League at-bat. The junior Rose’s two MLB hits give him and his father 4,258 hits, the fourth-most ever by a father and son behind Bobby and Barry Bonds, Ken Griffey Sr. and Jr., and Gus and Buddy Bell. (The Roses are also the only father-and-son combo to get over 6,000 hits in pro ball, majors and minors, with 6,467 at the end of 2009.)</p><table class="table-hover table-striped"><tbody readability=1.5><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Pete Rose Jr.</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>First Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Chokri</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Last Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Belaid</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Occupation</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Baseball Player</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birthday</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>November 16</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Year</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>1969</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Place of Birth</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Cincinnati</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Home Town</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Ohio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Country</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>United States</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Birth Sign</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Scorpio</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Full/Birth Name</td><td class=quick-facts-td2></td></tr><tr readability=3><td class=quick-facts-td>Parents</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Pete Rose, Karolyn Englehardt</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Siblings</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Spouse</td><td class=quick-facts-td2><strong>Shannon Rose</strong></td></tr><tr><td class=quick-facts-td>Children(s)</td><td class=quick-facts-td2>Not Available</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Ethnicity, religion & political views</h3><p align=justify>Many peoples want to know what is <strong>Pete Rose Jr. ethnicity, nationality, Ancestry</strong> & Race?
