In the '90s, it was the oft-maligned sitcom Full House that just so happened to come on at the right place and the right time. With reality TV, shows like <a href=#>The Curse of Oak Island</a> persist despite the fact that they never really seem to find anything (the real treasures are the friendships we made along the way, I guess).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How much does Rob Dyrdek make per episode of 'Ridiculousness?'</h2><p>As I'm writing this article, I went on over to MTV's schedule of TV shows and, would you look at that, look at what the next three half hour blocks of programming are. (Spoiler alert, it's Ridiculousness.)</p><p>Seriously, go and click on this link whenever you're reading this article and see how far you have to scroll either <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">up or down to see when Ridiculousness</a> is coming on.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><p>It just happens to be one of those shows that can be on in the background no matter what you're doing, and chances are that there probably really isn't any content that you're watching on the show for the first time, because for the most part it's an aggregate of viral clips that have probably become stale by the time they've made it to TV.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>It's also not like the guests or the hosts make a ton of insightful jokes or commentary about the clips they're watching either.</p><p>But for some reason, the show just ... works. There's the production cost of it to consider. It's a generally simple endeavor to execute.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>You have a fun yet small studio decked out with an interesting layout. You've got the show's host of Rob and Big fame along with <a href=#>Chanel West Coast</a> and Steelo Brim, and a guest who watches the videos and reacts to what they're seeing.</p><p>It's like you and a bunch of your friends are just vegging out on the couch and watching a bunch of viral clips, but you're watching someone and their friends veg out on a couch and watch viral clips.</p><p>It's wild.</p><p>But it makes sense when you consider how hugely popular other twice-removed spectator sports and events are receiving online. <a href=#>Video game streaming, for instance, is a huge, huge business</a>. Folks love watching other people play and comment on playing video games, which are, in of themselves, virtual activities that usually simulate real-life actions or skills.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Which brings us to Rod Dyrdek's salary for 'Ridiculousness.'</h2><p>The show pulls in some very, very big numbers and as a result, Rob's able to pull in some big numbers for himself. Since there really isn't much to the program, there must be something about the trinity of Rob, Chanel, and Steelo that makes Ridiculousness work, and MTV doesn't want to mess with that format.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Rob, as a result, earns a reported $140,000 per episode ... and he's starred in more than 500 episodes of the series. As for Chanel West Coast, there are conflicting figures about what she makes, but more than a few outlets have reported that her net worth currently stands at $3 million.</p><p>Again, there are other outlets who claim that both Rob, Steelo, and Chanel each make $140,000 an episode, which would be great news for Steelo, considering his relatively "light" <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IMDb page</a>.</p><p>Good for them.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Someone please let MTV out of their 360 deal with Ridiculousness</p>— lee (@sweethoneyhaze) <a href=#>October 13, 2021</a></figure><p>So what do you think about these Ridiculousness salaries?
