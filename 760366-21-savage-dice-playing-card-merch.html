The set of three d6 dice and a velvet bag costs $25 while a back of regulation playing cards costs $15. At the time of writing, the playing cards have already sold out. The new merch was released with very little fanfare but was clearly inspired by the ongoing scandal with Ross.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Of course, as mentioned, this all comes after 21 was roasted online for allegedly using marked cards against Adin Ross during a stream. 21 denied any knowledge of the cards. However, he said he would honor his debt and pay Ross the full amount he owed. The rapper had been down $400K at one point in the stream. He then made a miraculous comeback, eventually cashing out with Ross owing him $120K.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-adin-ross-confirms-21-savage-reimbursed-him-after-marked-cards-scandal>Adin Ross Confirms 21 Savage Reimbursed Him After Marked Cards Scandal</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, during a phone call with Kai Cenat, Ross cleared the air about the ongoing situation with 21. First, Ross made it very clear that he did not blame 21 for the marked cards during their recent high-stakes gambling stream. Instead, Ross placed the blame on a member of Savage's crew. Furthermore, Ross confirmed that since the stream, he had received a $250K payment from 21 to settle their debt. Cenat was simply happy that Ross, a close friend of his, had "got that bread".</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Meanwhile, 21 is not the only rapper that Ross has been rolling with lately. <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Drake</a> has revealed to Adin Ross that he needs $3M to fly on the rapper's private jet, Air <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>. The revelation came as Drake dialed into Ross' latest stream. However, Ross, who is either a multi-millionaire or <a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">broke</a> depending on the day, appeared confident that he could put the money together to cop a ride on the luxury airliner. Despite this, Drake held firm and let Ross know that there were no "friends and family discount" on an Air Drake trip. It was $3M or nothing.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Benjamin Mock (they/them) is a sports and culture writer working out of Philadelphia.
