The musician has been making waves in the industry since she recorded her first album, the eponymous Taylor Swift in 2004.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Since then, Swift has released another eight studio albums, which has catapulted her to the highest echelons of musical fame. For her outstanding work in those two decades or so, she is now the proud winner of a whopping 11 Grammy Awards.</p><p>Her most recent Grammy was in 2021, for her 2020 album Folklore in the category Album of the Year. It was the third time she was bagging that particular accolade, making it <a href=#>her most successful category</a> at the awards.</p><p>On top of her incredible musical career, dabbled quite a bit into the art of acting. Still only 32, Swift has already made some <a href=#>memorable cameos in various movies and TV shows</a>. Some of her biggest acting roles were in the movies Valentine's Day (2010), and the 2019 musical Cats, which was, however, widely panned by critics and audiences.</p><p>She could have featured in a much more successful musical, though, had director Tom Hooper cast her in his 2012 sensation, Les Misérables.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=what-was-the-film-39-les-mis-eacute-rables-39-about>What Was The Film 'Les Misérables' About?</h2><p>Les Misérables is a classic story that was first conceptualized as a novel by French poet, novelist and playwright Victor Hugo in 1852. A lot of modern versions of the story would be born, mostly inspired by a stage musical written by two French producers in 1980.</p><p>A non-musical film starring Liam Neeson was made by Danish director Bille August in 1998. The 2012 picture followed the same plot line, as was penned by William Nicholson, with the help of the two French producer-lyricists who wrote the 1980 musical.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The synopsis for Les Misérables on Rotten Tomatoes</a> reads, 'After 19 years as a prisoner, Jean Valjean is freed by Javert, the officer in charge of the prison workforce. Valjean promptly breaks parole but later uses money from stolen silver to reinvent himself as a mayor and factory owner.'</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>15 Movies Most People Don't Know Were Adapted From Shakespeare</a></span></p><p>'Javert vows to bring Valjean back to prison,' the plot summary reads on. 'Eight years later, Valjean becomes the guardian of a child named Cosette after her mother's death, but Javert's relentless pursuit means that peace will be a long time coming.'</p><h2 id=which-role-in-39-les-mis-eacute-rables-39-did-taylor-swift-audition-for>Which Role In 'Les Misérables' Did Taylor Swift Audition For?</h2><p>Les Misérables is a very deep story that also has many characters. For the 2012 movie, a lot of top names were given roles in the ensemble cast. Hugh Jackman and Russell Crowe led the way with the two main parts - as Jean Valjean and Javert respectively.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=#>Taylor Swift's friend, Anne Hathaway</a> played the role of Fantine, a struggling worker who finds herself thrown out of a job in Valjean's factory after it is discovered that she has a child out of wedlock. Then 26 years old, Amanda Seyfried portrayed the grown-up version of Fantine's 'illegitimate' daughter, known as Cosette.</p><p>The role of young Cosette was played by English actress Isabelle Allen, who only turned 20 in March this year. At the beginning of the film, Cosette is shown to be living with two swindling innkeepers, who also have a daughter of their own - called Éponine. This is the part that Taylor Swift auditioned for, and reportedly did very well at it.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Taylor Swift's 10 Most Popular Songs (According To Spotify)</a></span></p><p>In the end, director Tom Hooper decided to go another direction, instead choosing to cast British actress and singer Samantha Barks in the role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=why-did-the-director-of-39-les-mis-eacute-rables-39-turn-down-taylor-swift-for-the-role-of-eacute-ponine>Why Did The Director Of 'Les Misérables' Turn Down Taylor Swift For The Role Of Éponine?</h2><p>After the success of Les Misérables, Tom Hooper returned to the directorial chair in 2015, for the biographical drama film, The Danish Girl. Once again, the British-Australian filmmaker hit the jackpot, with this project being nominated for multiple awards.</p><p>Out of four nominations at the 2016 Oscars, Alicia Vikander won Best Supporting Actress for her work in the film. Hooper's next big screen project would be Cats in 2019, which didn't quite receive the same kind of acclaim.</p><p>Having seriously considered casting Taylor Swift in Les Misérables, Hooper decided he would have her playing the character Bombalurina in Cats. In the wake of the movie's implosion, the director was <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">interviewed by Vulture magazine</a>.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It was then that he spoke about the 'flattering reason' which made him pass on Swift for Éponine in 2012. "[Taylor] rather brilliantly auditioned for Éponine," he said. "Ultimately, I couldn’t quite believe Taylor Swift was a girl people would overlook. So it didn’t quite feel right for her for the most flattering reason."</p><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>Reba McEntire Turned Down A Role In This $2 Billion Film Because She Was On Tour</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGirmrGcpL9uv9aina1ll6TBbsDUq6WenF2ZvLi6jJ%2Bmq2WcmsBuucisnKuZkqGytHs%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./the-10-horrific-spinoffs-we-need-after-winnie-the-pooh-blood-and-honey.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>The 10 horrific spinoffs we need after Winnie the Pooh: Blood and Honey</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./steve-harvey-shirley-strawberry-marjorie-leaked-jail-call.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>Steve Harvey breaks silence on Shirley Strawberry's leaked jail call to ex-husband about his wife Ma</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
