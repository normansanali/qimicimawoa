He made the discovery when he was walking along the shore of one of Australia’s most renowned fossil sites, Jan Juc on Victoria’s Surf Coast, and something caught his eye.</p><p>“I was walking along the beach looking for fossils, turned and saw this shining glint in a boulder and saw a quarter of the tooth exposed,” Mullaly said in a statement from Museums Victoria. “I was immediately excited, it was just perfect and I knew it was an important find that needed to be shared with people.”</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185391 alt="Teeth Excavation Site" width=859 height=457 data-sizes="(max-width: 859px) 100vw, 859px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/teeth-excavation-site.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185391 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Museums Victoria</span><span class=caption-body>Philip Mullaly and Dr. Erich Fitzgerald at the Jan Juc site where the fossilized teeth were found.</span></p><p>Mullaly’s discovery was indeed important as teeth are one of the most important tools that researchers have for studying sharks. The majority of a shark’s body is made up of cartilage, which does not fossilize, so researchers heavily rely on sharks’ fossilized teeth to discover information about how they lived.</p><p>And because sharks naturally lose so many teeth, researchers are often lucky enough to have all the evidence that they need. But even though sharks can lose up to one tooth per day, it is extremely rare to find more than one tooth at the same time. Mullaly was aware of this fact when he found his two teeth so he decided to contact Dr. Erich Fitzgerald, a paleontologist at Museums Victoria, and offered to donate the teeth to the museum.</p>Footage of the Dec. 2017 and Jan. 2018 expeditions in Jan Juc.<p>Fitzgerald realized that the teeth that Mullaly found must have come from the same species and suspected that there could be more teeth waiting to be discovered inside the boulder where Mullaly found the first two. He was right.</p><p>Fitzgerald, Mullaly, and a team of paleontologists set out to excavate the same spot at Jan Juc in Dec. 2017 and Jan. 2018. Their expedition discovered more than 40 new teeth from the boulder, most of them belonging to the&nbsp;Carcharocles angustidens. Some of the other teeth belonged to scavenging sixgill sharks that most likely lost some of their teeth there while eating the carcasses of the dead&nbsp;great jagged narrow-toothed sharks.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-185387 alt="Sixgill Sharks Eating" width=416 height=576 data-sizes="(max-width: 416px) 100vw, 416px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/sixgill-sharks-great-tooth.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-185387 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Peter Trusler</span><span class=caption-body>Illustration showing the carcass of a Carcharocles angustidens being feasted upon by several scavenging sixgill sharks.</span></p><p>Immediately, Fitzgerald knew that the teeth they’d uncovered were groundbreaking, telling CNN that he believes that they are one of the rarest finds in the history of paleontology.</p><p>“If you think about how long we’ve been looking for fossils around the world as a civilization – which is maybe 200 years – in (that time) we have found just three (sets of) fossils of this kind on the entire planet, and this most recent find from Australia is one of those three,” Fitzgerald said.</p><p>The astounding haul of teeth is now on display at the Melbourne Museum until Oct. 7, 2018.</p><p>Next, discover why <a href=#>mako sharks</a> should scare you as much as great whites.
