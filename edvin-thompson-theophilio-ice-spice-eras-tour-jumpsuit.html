When the rapper made a surprise performance during the New Jersey leg of <a href=# class=T3D>Swift’s buzzy Eras Tour</a>, the pair duetted in coordinating, <a href=# class=T3D>bejeweled</a> outfits. Leaning into the “spice” part of her stage name, Ice wore a sheer catsuit covered in feathers and rhinestones. The man behind that saucy number is Edvin Thompson, founder of fashion-favorite brand Theophilio.</p><p>“I really genuinely loved, loved, loved, loved her verse,” the designer tells Bustle. “It was an amazing opportunity to create something that was very sexy [and] champions the brand, because I do consider my clothes very, very sexy.” Instructed to make the rapper look like a “new-age Cher,” Thompson says his team created the now-viral look “within two to three weeks — ideating, creating a pattern, sample, and sketching. It was very seamless.”</p><p>If Thompson’s name sounds familiar, that’s because he’s been making waves in the fashion industry for years. Since launching <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Theophilio</a> in 2016, he’s become one of fashion’s brightest stars, even <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>taking home the CFDA award</a> for American Emerging Designer of the Year in 2021.</p><p>“I work very, very hard,” Thomspon said. “I’ve been operating from a very scarce space in the beginning, and out of that scarce space, it’s been amazing products.” Those products extend far beyond his own celebrity-backed label. He has partnered with brands like <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Luxury Stores at Amazon</a>, and most recently, <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Ecco Domani</a>, where he designed <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>his own bottle of Pinot Grigio</a>.</p><p>But perhaps his most notable full-circle moment was being name-checked in the <a href=# class=T3D>Gossip Girl</a><a href=# class=T3D> reboot</a> last December. After all, he was “totally obsessed” with <a href=# class=T3D>the original</a> as a kid. In Season 2, Upper East Side’s new queen bee Julien Calloway (Jordan Alexander) dons a striped jumpsuit boasting the brand’s trademark Carribean-inspired hues. When asked the brand, she responds, simply: “Theophilio.”</p><p>Ahead, more on the Eras Tour, Gossip Girl, and the advice he received from Telfar Clemens.</p><p><strong>Could you tell us a little bit about the inspiration behind Ice Spice’s Eras Tour look and how that collab came to be?</strong></p><p>I knew her stylist, Marissa [Pelly]. She sent over a creative deck on the direction they were looking to go. She wanted Ice to be somewhat of this new-age Cher. This would be a really, really cool debut moment for her and Taylor Swift. It was an amazing opportunity to create something that was very sexy [and] champions the brand, because I do consider my clothes very, very sexy. I want people to feel good in my designs, and she definitely echoed that.</p><p><strong>Why did you select the sheer jumpsuit specifically for “Karma”?</strong></p><p>It’s Taylor Swift’s tour, and usually, it’s more of these somewhat gaudy, <a href=# class=T3D>very sexy, bright pieces</a>. Working with different textiles and trimmings, it was right up my alley — especially, with the rhinestone embellishments. It’s just an echo of our design aesthetic over here at Theophilio. It’s somewhat similar to our souvenir <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>“I Love TP” T-shirt</a>, and it also reminded me of when I did <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Alton Mason’s custom [look</a>] for his very first Met Gala, back in 2021. So, I wanted to really follow that cadence.</p><p><strong>In </strong><strong>Gossip Girl, </strong><strong>Jordan Alexander wore a Theophilio look and name-checked the brand. How did that come about?</strong></p><p>I wasn’t told directly that it would be part of the script. I was so excited that [they chose] one of our hero products: our sleeveless pleated rasta jumpsuit, a complete stunner. Her wearing that trench coat, the bag, and the heel — it was right on cue. It was such an amazing moment. I was just like, “I would totally wear this to a party, for sure.” And, ironically enough, it somewhat represented the Ecco Domani bottle that I designed. I loved that.</p><figure class="Qf5 nbP" readability=2><p>Courtesy of Barbara Nitke/HBO Max</p></figure><p><strong>Tell me more about the Ecco Domani</strong> <strong>wine collab. What elements are quintessentially Theophilio?</strong></p><p>The black, gold, and green, really represent my Caribbean heritage — Jamaica, of course. Green is somewhat of their hero color, and it’s the same over here at Theophilio. So the whole process came naturally. I found it a very cool and unique way to extend the brand into the wine industry.</p><p><strong>Celebrities like Keke Palmer, Chloe Bailey, and Bella Hadid have worn your pieces. Which meant the most to you?</strong></p><p>That Keke Palmer moment was very gratifying, because she’s someone who I look up to — especially, her being in the industry for over two decades now. <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Her wearing my piece in the British Vogue</a> — I’m like, “Wow, she’s wearing a dress I made with my hands.” It was amazing. Shout out to <a href=# class=T3D>Law [Roach]</a>. I’m so happy that he created that moment for me.</p><p>I believe the shoe that she wore was Brother Vellies and, <a href=# class=T3D>Aurora [James]</a> also coming from Caribbean descent, it was a very important moment for me. I feel like that’s the most genuine, honest way we can really support each other — just really <a href=# class=T3D>amplifying our true voice</a>.</p><p><strong>Who’s your dream client to dress?</strong></p><p>I would absolutely say Beyoncé. I even [drafted] up sketches for her world tour, fingers crossed. Of course, Rihanna. I feel like she echoes our ideals. We just share the same message: really want to champion where we’re from, be a pillar of our community, and just speak to the world about our community through our work.</p><p><strong>Is there a piece of advice you’ve gotten from another designer that really stuck?</strong></p><p>Telfar Clemens. I asked him at [a] party once: “I’m progressing. There’s obstacles every day. How have you overcome all of that?” Because <a href=# class=T3D>Telfar is it</a>. His community is my community. He just shared: “You already have it. Just continue.” I felt that.</p><p>This interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunC%2F07KjnmeVmcOquoytn6iloKi8r3nToZyoqJieuaq7jKKanmWjpbaksYyeqZqrXam8tr6Mo6ymqKOqtrU%3D</p></div></article></main><nav class="pager flex"><div class="pager__item pager__item--prev"><a class=pager__link href=./watch-kelly-keegs-and-jordyn-woodruff-reveal-how-much-money-they-made-during-their-first-week-on-onlyfans.html rel=prev><span class=pager__subtitle>«&#8201;Previous</span><p class=pager__title>Watch: Kelly Keegs And Jordyn Woodruff Reveal How Much Money They Made During Their First Week On On</p></a></div><div class="pager__item pager__item--next"><a class=pager__link href=./the-ten-best-guy-films.html rel=next><span class=pager__subtitle>Next&#8201;»</span><p class=pager__title>The Ten Best Guy Films</p></a></div></nav></div><aside class=sidebar><div class="widget-recent widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Recent Posts</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./3-healthy-green-juice-recipes.html>3 Healthy Green Juice Recipes</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./dua-lipa-hooded-jumpsuit-leather-coat-saint-laurent.html>Dua Lipa Is Effortlessly Cool in a Hooded Jumpsuit and Floor-Length Leather Coat</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./janelle-brown-talking-to-kody-brown-about-other-wives-is-dangerous.html>Janelle Brown: Talking to Kody Brown About Other Wives Is 'Dangerous'</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./princess-misty-3.html>Princess Misty Age, Net Worth, Boyfriend, Family and Biography (Updated 2023)</a></li><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./10-moments-from-season-6-the-crown-that-are-historically-inaccurate-or-ambiguous.html>10 moments from season 6 The Crown that are historically inaccurate or ambiguous</a></li></ul></div></div><div class="widget-categories widget"><h4 class=widget__title>Categories</h4><div class=widget__content><ul class=widget__list><li class=widget__item><a class=widget__link href=./categories/blog/>blog</a></li></ul></div></div></aside></div><footer class=footer><div class="container footer__container flex"><div class=footer__copyright>&copy; 2024 JadeW.
