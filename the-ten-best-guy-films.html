Blood, gore and murder have never looked so pretty. The film is an epic exercise in slaughter and killing. It tells the story of an army of Spartans, 300 strong, who go up against Xerxes and the Persian army which numbers in the millions.</p><p data-characters=363 data-current-count=713 data-injectable=true>Visually arresting is an understatement to describe this film. Filmed almost entirely on a green screen, the battles play out perfectly. Slow motion, CG shenanigans, extraordinary feats and more fill the screen.
